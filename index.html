    const newsData = [{"title":"Forget Stalin and Trotsky, Animal Farm is a play for our times. Pringles anyone? | Alison Phillips","content":"In her article, Alison Phillips discusses a new stage adaptation of George Orwell's \"Animal Farm,\" emphasizing its enduring relevance 80 years after its publication. During a performance, she reflects on her son's concern for the character Boxer, symbolizing the exploited masses under oppressive regimes. Phillips outlines how Orwell faced challenges in getting the book published due to its clear criticism of Stalinism, which was controversial at the time.\n\nShe draws parallels between Orwell's themes and current political situations, noting how leaders manipulate their narratives and centralize power, highlighting the plight of ordinary people. While acknowledging the potential for political situations to stabilize, she warns of the ongoing struggles faced by the working class, as exemplified by Boxer’s fate.\n\nAdditionally, the article mentions a humorous aside about the troubling trend of people not wearing socks in cold weather, juxtaposing this observation with broader societal changes. Overall, Phillips advocates for the continued exploration of Orwell's work in the context of modern political dynamics."},{"title":"Chill of inflation threatens Britain again after Europe’s long, hard winter","content":"Inflation is threatening Britain once again, with gas prices soaring due to increased demand during a cold winter in Europe. Analysts predict inflation will rise from 2.5% in December to 2.8% in January, potentially reaching 3.7% by the end of the year. The return of inflation may negatively impact households and businesses, with unemployment expected to rise to 4.5%, up from 4.4%. Although the economy showed a slight growth of 0.1% last quarter, experts are cautious about the outlook for job growth amidst rising inflation.\n\nThere are mixed forecasts regarding the economy, with some predicting stagflation characterized by high inflation and unemployment. However, others believe the unemployment rate will stabilize around 4.5% by the end of the year. The possibility of an end to the Ukraine war could result in reduced energy prices, which would help alleviate inflation; yet, current forecasts remain uncertain due to geopolitical factors, including potential trade tariffs under Trump’s administration, which may affect hiring and economic stability."},{"title":"If the AI Roundheads go to war with tech royalty, don’t bet against them | John Naughton","content":"In John Naughton's article, he discusses a potential civil war within the tech industry regarding the future of artificial intelligence (AI). He contrasts two factions: the \"AI Cavaliers,\" who aim for artificial general intelligence (AGI), and the \"AI Roundheads,\" who focus on efficiently solving specific problems with AI. \n\nNaughton critiques major tech companies like Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta for their massive investments in AI, which he argues may not yield a viable business model. He suggests that their motivation is driven by a fear of missing out and the desire to avoid returning excess profits to shareholders. The entry of China's DeepSeek-R1 signals that there may be alternative, less resource-intensive paths to AI, challenging the prevailing brute-force computing approach favored by these American giants.\n\nHighlighting successes from DeepMind under Demis Hassabis, Naughton points out that the Roundheads have made significant advancements by focusing on targeted applications such as protein folding and drug discovery. He believes that if a civil war arises in AI, supporting the Roundheads would be wise, suggesting a bright future for AI applications that prioritize problem-solving over chasing the elusive AGI."},{"title":"Stunning artworks give this ‘boho wild’ 19th-century apartment in Helsinbourg its distinct charm","content":"Marie Olsson Nylander, a self-taught interior decorator and antique dealer, has transformed a 19th-century apartment in Helsingborg, Sweden, into a stunning embodiment of her \"boho wild\" style. The large apartment, constructed in 1884, features a blend of vintage design, soft colors, and an array of secondhand and antique furniture. Marie was drawn to the apartment's architectural elements, such as its large windows and vaulted areas, which she describes as having an immediate allure.\n\nThroughout the space, Marie collaborated with an artist friend to paint some walls, while leaving others untouched to serve as desirable backdrops for photographs. The apartment's interior balances comfort and aesthetic appeal, highlighted by cozy carpets and seating. Marie's love for unique and beautiful objects is evident, as she often imagines rooms around her finds.\n\nA prominent color in her decor is a \"dirty, dusty pink,\" which she prefers in home textiles rather than clothing. Marie values imperfections in her spaces, finding beauty in the cracks of life, and embraces creativity in her projects. Her mantra encourages hard work and resilience as she curates an inviting and original home atmosphere."},{"title":"First patient in UK tests new treatment for loss of sense of smell","content":"The first patient in the UK, Chrissi Kelly, has begun testing a new treatment aimed at restoring the sense of smell lost due to viral infections such as Covid. This treatment involves injections of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) derived from the patient's own blood, which may help regenerate the olfactory nerve responsible for smell, a unique capability among cranial nerves.\n\nKelly, who lost her sense of smell after developing sinusitis in 2012, described her condition as feeling like a bereavement. While some patients typically regain their sense of smell after a viral infection, others, like Kelly, do not. She has since experienced phantosmia (smelling things that aren't there) and parosmia (distorted smell perception).\n\nResearch led by Prof. Zara Patel indicated that PRP could aid in nerve regeneration, with trials showing more significant effects over time compared to placebo treatments. The hope is to roll out this minimally invasive procedure across the NHS, especially since PRP is already used in other treatments and poses fewer regulatory challenges.\n\nAs Kelly continues her treatment, she remains cautiously optimistic about its effectiveness. Early signs suggest some improvement, including a recent instance where she recognized the scent of winter-flowering jasmine."},{"title":"Europe will not take part in US-Russia talks with Ukraine, Trump envoy says","content":"Europe will not be part of the upcoming peace talks regarding Ukraine, Russia, and the US, according to Keith Kellogg, Donald Trump's special envoy for Ukraine. While Europe will be consulted, Kellogg emphasized that they would ultimately be excluded, urging European nations to focus on proposing concrete solutions and increasing defense spending instead of complaining about their absence from negotiations. Kellogg noted that past negotiations failed due to the involvement of too many countries lacking execution capability. \n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has expressed concern about Europe's exclusion and emphasized the need for a coordinated European military presence. He stressed the importance of Ukraine being involved in any decisions made about its future. European leaders are worried that a US-centric negotiation could lead to unfavorable outcomes for European security and have called for a unified action plan regarding Ukraine. As discussions continue, Zelenskyy seeks long-term US security commitments despite the difficult negotiating position amid Trump's influence."},{"title":"Ari review – a French primary teacher flunks out in daydreaming misfire","content":"The review of \"Ari,\" a film by French director Léonore Serraille, describes it as an underdeveloped narrative about a young, self-absorbed former primary school teacher who fails to find his footing after quitting his job. The film begins with a comedic yet disheartening scene where Ari, portrayed by Adrianic Manet, embarrassingly fails to engage his young students, which is amusing but also reveals his ineptitude. While he shows potential and charm in flashbacks, the story lacks clarity and depth, leaving viewers puzzled about his character's inconsistency. The film meanders through Ari's interactions with friends, but ultimately does not resolve his conflicts or provide satisfying insights. Despite Serraille's previous successful works, this film is viewed as a misfire, marking a disappointing entry in her career."},{"title":"UK rushes forward plans for £2.5bn steel investment after Trump announces tariffs","content":"The UK government is accelerating its plans for a £2.5 billion investment in the steel industry in response to Donald Trump's announcement of a 25% tariff on steel imports into the US. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds will publish a green paper called \"Plan for Steel,\" which outlines strategies to bolster the domestic steel sector. The urgency stems from the potential negative impact of US tariffs on UK exports, which amount to about £400 million annually. \n\nThe government aims to facilitate innovative private sector-led projects to strengthen the steel industry, which is considered crucial for key infrastructure developments. There are separate allocations, including £500 million earmarked for Tata Steel's new production at Port Talbot. The green paper will address long-term industry challenges, with some investment expected for electric arc furnaces that reduce fossil fuel use. The UK government emphasizes a firm future for the steel industry despite current challenges, while calling for a balanced approach in international negotiations regarding tariffs."},{"title":"Man charged in killing of healthcare CEO responds to supporters on website","content":"Luigi Mangione, the 26-year-old charged with the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, has expressed gratitude to supporters on a newly launched defense website. He claimed that the support he received transcended political, racial, and class divisions, citing a significant volume of messages from across the nation and internationally.\n\nMangione, who is facing multiple charges, including three counts of murder and a federal charge that could lead to the death penalty, has pleaded not guilty. While awaiting trial in Brooklyn, he has been vocal in the media, previously criticizing coverage of the incident.\n\nDespite some public sentiment viewing him as a vigilante, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro condemned the idea that Mangione is a hero, emphasizing the dangers of vigilante justice. A recent poll indicated that while many believe the health insurance industry shares some blame for the murder, a significant majority still hold Mangione primarily responsible.\n\nFinancial support for Mangione’s legal defense has surpassed $425,000, with funds being raised through the GiveSendGo platform. The website aims to provide factual information regarding the charges against him."},{"title":"Championship roundup: Burnley held by Preston despite 11th clean sheet in a row","content":"Burnley maintained an impressive defensive streak with their 11th consecutive clean sheet in the Championship but were held to a frustrating 0-0 draw against local rivals Preston. Despite several promising opportunities, including key misses from Lyle Foster, the Clarets continued their trend of scoreless draws this season. Preston remains resilient at home, having lost only once since manager Paul Heckingbottom took charge.\n\nIn another match, Cardiff earned a late equalizer against Bristol City in a 1-1 draw. Yousef Salech scored in the 90th minute after Jason Knight had initially put Bristol ahead. The match, characterized by a cautious first half, came alive with both teams taking more risks after the break."},{"title":"Memoir of a Snail review – Adam Elliot’s stop-motion animation is brilliantly bleak","content":"\"Memoir of a Snail,\" directed by Adam Elliot, is a stop-motion animation that presents a brilliantly bleak narrative. The film, featuring Sarah Snook as the voice of Grace Pudel, tells the tragic story of a woman whose life is filled with relentless misfortune.

The film's aesthetic reflects shades of despair, drawing on themes of loneliness and outsider experiences. Overall, \"Memoir of a Snail\" stands as a testament to Elliot's ability to create poignant narratives that resonate deeply with audiences."},{"title":"More than 80% of new California properties are in high fire-risk areas","content":"More than 80% of properties built in California between 2020 and 2022 are situated in high fire-risk areas, as reported by ClimateCheck. This increase in construction in fire-prone regions reflects a broader trend across the United States, where nearly one-third of new homes are now at high risk of wildfires, up from 13% in 1990. \n\nFactors contributing to this trend include the COVID-19 pandemic, which prompted many people to leave dense urban areas for smaller cities or rural regions, often opting for homes located in wildfire-prone zones. In California, the challenge of building dense housing has pushed many into single-family homes, further expanding into the wildland urban interface. \n\nInsurance companies are responding to this heightened risk by limiting new home insurance applications in California, leaving many residents to navigate complex post-fire insurance battles. Experts emphasize the need for stricter building codes and better emergency planning to mitigate risks. The overall rising frequency of wildfires is significantly linked to climate change, exacerbating the danger to homes in these vulnerable areas."},{"title":"On my radar: Malachi Kirby’s cultural highlights","content":"Malachi Kirby, an actor and writer, shares his cultural highlights, revealing his interests and experiences.

Kirby admires the show's themes of a woman's resilience in a male-dominated environment, reflecting on how it has inspired his cooking.\n\n5. **Place**: South Bank in London, especially in the summer, is a favored spot for Kirby. It’s a space where people from all walks of life coexist comfortably, and he has fond memories of writing and napping there.\n\n6. **Theatre**: *Retrograde*, a play about Sidney Poitier, which he looks forward to seeing again in the West End. He praises the writing and performance, finding it relevant to contemporary themes.\n\nKirby’s highlights reflect his passions for food, film, and diverse cultural experiences."},{"title":"Extreme weather is our new reality. We must accept it and begin planning | Gaia Vince","content":"Extreme weather has become a permanent aspect of our lives, as illustrated by the increasing frequency of wildfires, floods, droughts, and record-high temperatures. As of early 2025, global temperatures have already risen 1.75°C above preindustrial levels, evidenced by January being recorded as the hottest month ever. This has serious implications, demanding an honest acknowledgment from global leaders and a re-evaluation of our strategies for living in this new reality of recurrent disasters.\n\nWe face a world where extreme weather events not only threaten human life but also disrupt economies and displace communities. The rich are confronted with the grim reality of becoming climate refugees, while poorer regions experience devastating effects that lead to cyclical poverty, as seen in places like Kenya where drought and floods create unlivable conditions. This crisis impacts agricultural productivity globally and drives up food prices, affecting the most vulnerable populations.\n\nThe article calls for urgent adaptive planning to confront these challenges, moving away from climate denial. It highlights successful examples, such as the Netherlands' long-standing flood adaptation techniques, and advocates for a multi-faceted approach combining technological with social resilience. Building societal networks and providing communities with reliable services and emergency preparedness are key to mitigating the catastrophic potential of these disasters.\n\nIn conclusion, we must embrace this new reality and begin implementing more pragmatic strategies to prepare for the inevitable impacts of climate change, ensuring that all communities are equipped to face the challenges ahead."},{"title":"It’s time to rethink boredom, procrastination and regret","content":"The article “It’s time to rethink boredom, procrastination and regret” by Simon May explores the complexities of procrastination and how traditional advice often fails to address the deeper issues behind it. May discusses how procrastination can hinder personal goals and desires, including significant life choices like relationships and creative pursuits.\n\nHe argues that rather than viewing priorities as burdens that need rigid management, we should see them as opportunities for playful exploration. This playful mindset can unlock creativity and motivation, making tasks feel less daunting. May suggests that emotions like regret and boredom, often seen as negative, can serve as useful signals to re-evaluate our ambitions and approaches to life.\n\nRegret, as exemplified by philosopher Søren Kierkegaard's struggles, can lead to deeper insights about what truly matters to us. The author also reflects on Leo Tolstoy's existential crisis, suggesting that fulfillment should not be expected to be stable and that the journey of pursuing our passions is what brings joy.\n\nUltimately, May encourages readers to confront their mortality, suggesting that a heightened awareness of life's transience can ignite passion and commitment, countering procrastination. He advocates for embracing the journey and finding joy in the process rather than focusing solely on outcomes. The call to action is clear: prioritize what you love, engage with it playfully, and recognize the fleeting nature of life."},{"title":"Merino to the rescue as late double fires Arsenal to victory over Leicester","content":"In the Premier League match against Leicester, Mikel Merino played a crucial role in Arsenal's victory, scoring two late goals to secure a 2-0 win. The game was challenging for Arsenal, who were without key players like Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Martinelli, Gabriel Jesus, and Kai Havertz, the latter of whom is out for the season.

Leicester fans were left disheartened, while Arsenal supporters celebrated Merino's heroics."},{"title":"Killings across three states shine spotlight on cultlike ‘Zizian’ group","content":"The recent killings of U.S. border patrol agent David Maland and five others in Vermont, Pennsylvania, and California have brought attention to a cultlike group known as the \"Zizians.\" Authorities are currently searching for Teresa Youngblut, who is linked to the group and faces charges related to Maland's death during a January shootout after a traffic stop. Youngblut was reportedly traveling with Felix Bauckholt, who died in the incident.\n\nThe group appears to consist of young, intelligent individuals, many of whom have faced legal issues. Some members previously protested against a rationalist group in California, while others have been involved in violent incidents, including an altercation with landlord Curtis Lind that resulted in one member's death. The case has further complicated with the recent murder of Lind.\n\nThe investigation continues as various members, including Youngblut and Jack LaSota, evade law enforcement, with bench warrants issued for LaSota's arrest due to missed court appearances.

The club currently employs around 80 scouts, including 30 full-time and approximately 50 part-time or casual workers. The proposed reductions are tied to an industry trend favoring data-driven player assessments and will likely impact recruitment at both senior and youth levels.\n\nThe scouting operation is crucial for Manchester United, known for its strong academy that has produced many successful players over the years. The head of recruitment is expected to be Christopher Vivell, the former Chelsea technical director, who is anticipated to be appointed permanently.\n\nThis transition comes during a financially challenging period for the club, which has lost £300 million over the past three years and struggles to make significant new signings without selling players first. This scaling back of the scouting network could hinder the club's future recruitment efforts, which are essential for their goals of winning championships in the coming years."},{"title":"British professor makes ‘thrilling’ breakthrough for cancer that killed his mother","content":"Professor Paul Workman, who lost his mother Ena to chordoma, a rare and untreatable bone cancer, has made significant strides in cancer research. His discovery of a key protein, brachyury, essential for the survival of chordoma cells, opens potential avenues for treatment. This breakthrough was facilitated by advanced X-ray technology at the Diamond Light Source synchrotron, enabling Workman and his team to identify target sites for drug development. Promising compounds are now being created to attack brachyury, which could not only help in treating chordoma but may also have implications for other, more common cancers. Workman emphasized the need for more research and clinical trials before a treatment can be made available, a process that may take around five years. This work is especially personal for Workman, who is motivated by his mother's experience with the disease."},{"title":"Saying ‘women’ is not allowed, but ‘men’ and ‘white’ are OK? I’m (not) shocked","content":"The article discusses the growing trend of certain political movements, particularly under Donald Trump's administration, to restrict the use of specific language, particularly related to gender and identity. It highlights that while the word \"women\" is becoming increasingly marginalized in official discourse, terms pertaining to \"men\" and \"white\" remain unchallenged. This has led to self-censorship among researchers and academics who fear repercussions for using terms that have been flagged as problematic. The situation is portrayed as a form of language policing that contradicts the ideals of free speech, with significant implications for research and discussions that involve women's health and rights. The author expresses frustration at the irony of those advocating for a return to traditional language while suppressing essential conversations about gender and identity."},{"title":"Cyndi Lauper review – a freedom fighter’s swan song","content":"Cyndi Lauper's farewell tour performance at the O2 in London is described as rich in colorful pop and personal anecdotes, transcending a mere nostalgic tribute to her hits.

His comments underscored a dramatic ideological divide between the Trump administration and European leaders, moving beyond traditional military concerns to deeper societal values.\n\nVance criticized established European elites, suggesting their actions had undermined democracy and freedom of speech, elevating instead the populist right. He framed the \"greatest danger\" to Europe not as external threats from Russia or China, but as internal challenges stemming from what he viewed as a disconnect between the ruling elite and the electorate.\n\nHis remarks implied that if European leaders feared their voters, then the United States could not offer support. He articulated that NATO's purpose might be compromised if the democratic values it was meant to defend were no longer shared between Europe and the U.S. This shift not only redefined political discussions but also shook the foundations of joint security efforts.\n\nResponses from European leaders, such as German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, highlighted their commitment to confronting extremist ideologies, with Scholz stressing Germany’s resolve against parties rooted in historical fascism. Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskyy pointed out that the relationship between Europe and America was evolving, advocating for a stronger European military presence.\n\nOverall, Vance’s address was not merely a political critique but a call to action for the populist right, signaling a potential realignment of alliances in a precarious global landscape. The speech reflected a significant rupture and raised questions about the future of transatlantic cooperation."},{"title":"Previous victim of woman linked to death of journalist says he tried to warn public","content":"David Butler, a man who survived being drugged and robbed by Danette Colbert in 2021, expressed his concerns about her potential danger to society after she was linked to the death of journalist Adan Manzano. Butler had previously attempted to warn the public and the courts about Colbert, fearing she might kill someone if allowed to remain free. After being found dead in his hotel room shortly after meeting Colbert, Manzano's case prompted renewed scrutiny of her past actions, including drugging and robbing multiple victims. Colbert, previously given probation in Butler's case, is now facing potential charges related to Manzano's death, as authorities investigate whether she may have drugged him before his demise. Butler is advocating for stricter consequences for individuals like Colbert to prevent future tragedies."},{"title":"Why is Trump behaving like a bully over tariffs? Because he can | Gene Marks","content":"In the article \"Why is Trump behaving like a bully over tariffs? Because he can,\" Gene Marks argues that Donald Trump's aggressive use of tariffs is a reflection of the overwhelming power of the U.S. economy, which he likens to a bully. The author highlights that the U.S. economy is significantly larger than those of its neighboring countries, allowing Trump to impose his will without significant repercussions.\n\nMarks suggests that Trump uses tariffs as a weapon to threaten smaller nations like Canada and Mexico, confident that they are economically dependent on the U.S. While some industries benefit from these tariffs, many others face increased costs and uncertainty. Business owners are responding by adjusting their strategies, seeking alternative suppliers, and building inventory to mitigate the effects.\n\nThe article raises questions about the long-term efficacy of Trump's tariff strategy in creating a level playing field for American businesses and improving economic conditions. Ultimately, Marks concludes that Trump's behavior is a conscious choice, reflecting the desires of those who voted for him, despite potential negative impacts on businesses and consumers."},{"title":"Trump threats to revoke status unsettle Ohio’s Ukrainians: ‘The stress is real’","content":"Thousands of Ukrainians residing in Cleveland, Ohio, face uncertainty as the Trump administration threatens to revoke Temporary Protected Status (TPS). Many have fled Ukraine due to the ongoing war and have established new lives in the U.S. Mykola Vashchuk, a Ukrainian immigrant, highlights the anxiety surrounding pending TPS applications after Trump paused the decision on the Uniting for Ukraine parole program, which previously allowed about 150,000 Ukrainians to enter the U.S. legally.\n\nDespite the Biden administration extending TPS for over 100,000 Ukrainians for an additional 18 months, Trump's review of the TPS program raises fears of possible deportations or loss of residency for immigrants from various countries, including Ukraine. The tight-knit Ukrainian community in Cleveland, which has historical roots, actively contributes to the economy and culture, yet many individuals are grappling with anxiety about their immigration status amidst the chaos of war in Ukraine. \n\nResidents like Tetiana express concern over their families' safety and their precarious legal status in the U.S. Amidst ongoing instability, the emotional toll and uncertainty about the future remain significant for these families, as they strive to navigate life in a new country while also worrying about loved ones back home.

His comments have been described as extremist, particularly after he claimed that these policies infringe upon the liberties of religious individuals. Critics, including health organizations and politicians, labeled his remarks as misogynistic and based on misinformation.\n\nVance specifically pointed to the case of Adam Smith-Connor, who was convicted for silently praying near an abortion clinic in violation of a safe zone. He suggested that Scottish regulations warn against private prayer, which the Scottish government refuted, stating that such prayer is not prohibited. Advocates for abortion rights emphasized that safe access zones are essential for protecting women from harassment while seeking healthcare services.\n\nSeveral officials condemned Vance’s statements, stressing that they perpetuate dangerous rhetoric against women's rights and misrepresent the legal context surrounding abortion access in the UK."},{"title":"One to watch: Twat Union","content":"Twat Union is an all-female punk-rock band based in London, drawing inspiration from feminist movements like riot grrrl. Formed during the tail end of the lockdown in a shared house that doubled as a jam space, the six-piece band explores themes such as UTIs, sexism, and the challenges faced by women through their music.

He is particularly focused on seeking details about briefings provided to Prince Andrew by the Ministry of Defence and the annual costs of royal security, arguing for a public register of royal interests. \n\nConcerns have been raised about the level of scrutiny the monarchy, particularly Prince Andrew, receives since the funding model changed to the sovereign grant in 2012.

The ‘reader effect’ saved us","content":"On August 12, 2022, Henry Reese was set to interview Salman Rushdie at the Chautauqua Institution when Rushdie was attacked. Reese, co-founder of City of Asylum, reflected on the incident and described how the audience, an engaged community of readers, instinctively rushed to help Rushdie, a phenomenon he termed the \"reader effect.\" This effect suggests that reading fiction fosters empathy, which contrasts sharply with the declining rates of fiction readership in the U.S., where only 38% of adults reportedly read a novel or short story in 2022.\n\nReese emphasized that the lack of fiction reading exacerbates ideological polarization and reduces empathy among individuals. He cited research showing that non-readers tend to be lonelier and less tolerant of differing perspectives. To combat this trend, he noted that arts organizations could emulate the \"reader effect\" through community programming and interactions that foster empathy and understanding.\n\nReese recounted an earlier event in 2005, where an exiled poet's performance brought a diverse audience together, demonstrating how shared artistic experiences can create connections analogous to those found in reading fiction. He concluded by urging the importance of community in fostering freedom and empathy, echoing Rushdie’s beliefs on the necessity of communal living for true freedom."},{"title":"Coconut chicken, hispi with beans and pork with pineapple: Ravinder Bhogal’s recipes for winter braises","content":"Ravinder Bhogal presents three comforting winter braises: \n\n1. **Aromatic Coconut Chicken and Potatoes**: A whole chicken braised in a rich coconut milk broth with spices.

It successfully filled a gap in the film industry for authentic representations of young people, contrasting sharply with both corny after-school specials and raunchy comedies of the time.\n\nDespite its impact, the film has faced recent scrutiny regarding its portrayal of relationships and themes, particularly in light of evolving societal norms. Molly Ringwald has voiced concerns about the dynamics between characters, suggesting that they reflect troubling aspects of culture rather than innocent flirtation, especially in relation to issues of consent and harassment.\n\nWhile critics acknowledge Hughes’ insightful take on teenage struggles, they also note its shortcomings, such as overgeneralizations and underdeveloped character arcs. The film wraps up with a sense of conventional happy endings that can undermine its earlier emotional truths, suggesting a conservative resolution that may overlook deeper issues of adolescence.\n\nIn retrospect, \"The Breakfast Club\" serves as both a nostalgic look at teen life and a reminder of its own flawed impulses. It set a template that others have followed, establishing themes of connection and understanding that remain relevant, though its execution invites critical examination amidst contemporary perspectives."},{"title":"How Manchester United are making big profits and huge losses at the same time","content":"Manchester United is currently facing a unique financial situation where the club is reporting both significant profits and substantial losses simultaneously. Recently, Sir Jim Ratcliffe's minority investment in the club was hailed as a positive development by fans. However, shortly thereafter, the club announced further job cuts and staff benefit reductions, which were attributed to the need to reduce costs amid financial difficulties.\n\nDespite predicting an Ebitda profit of £145-160 million for the year ending June 2025, the club has also disclosed over £300 million in pre-tax losses over the past three years. This duality arises from differing definitions of profit, often influenced by what stakeholders aim to convey—whether to investors or fans. A significant factor contributing to these losses is the club's heavy expenditure on player transfers, amounting to £2.1 billion since 2013, which has left them with substantial outstanding transfer fees, primarily owed to other clubs.\n\nAdditionally, operational costs remain high, with over £340 million in recent years on player amortisation and other expenses. This financial strain has been further exacerbated by the Glazer family's management decisions, including costs associated with the sale of shares to Ratcliffe, leading to mixed financial signals from a club that has historically been a financial powerhouse.\n\nWhile Manchester United continues to generate considerable revenue, criticisms arise around their approach to managing staff and costs, creating a complex narrative where the club must navigate both profit and loss amidst ongoing concerns from fans about financial sustainability and ownership."},{"title":"‘Rugby can be pretty complicated’: Cole and Youngs tackle plain speaking in hit podcast","content":"Dan Cole and Ben Youngs, two veteran players from the England rugby team, have launched a podcast titled \"For the Love of Rugby.\" This platform allows them to share insights and experiences from their long careers in rugby, offering a unique perspective that differs from traditional media interviews.

With only 1.7% of the population actively worshipping, Jenkins highlights ongoing turmoil in the C of E regarding safeguarding issues and internal governance, which reflects a shift from being a state institution to just another religious sect.\n\nJenkins points to declining attendance and belief in God among the British populace, alongside the presence of more practicing Muslims than Anglicans. He critiques the church's cumbersome hierarchy and bureaucracy, noting the significant closure of churches and the challenge of maintaining heritage buildings with dwindling congregations. The local church, while historically significant, now struggles for relevance as community hubs.\n\nTo preserve these local churches, Jenkins suggests transferring them to community management, adapting their use for various local activities like libraries or community centers, and ultimately calls for the disestablishment of the C of E at a national level while re-establishing its role at a local level. He argues that Britain can function without an official church, advocating for a repurposing of these buildings to serve the community better."},{"title":"Charlotte Edwards: ‘I want to get English cricket back to where I know it can be’","content":"Charlotte Edwards, the former England women's cricket captain, expressed her desire to help restore English cricket to its former glory following the team's disappointing performance in the recent Ashes series against Australia.

Moreover, his ownership of Manchester United has led to drastic cost-cutting measures deemed necessary to stabilize the club's finances and restore its competitive status.\n\nThe overarching narrative suggests that while diversification has aimed to bolster Ratcliffe's empire, the struggles in both the chemical and automotive sectors—coupled with external economic pressures—indicate a potential miscalculation in this ambitious business strategy."},{"title":"How to turn an old bread crust into a delectable British pudding – recipe | Waste not","content":"**How to Turn an Old Bread Crust Into a Delectable British Pudding – Recipe**\n\nTreacle tart is a classic British dessert perfect for using stale bread.

At a conference in Munich, Vance criticized Germany's current government just before elections where the far-right AfD party is expected to perform strongly. His meeting with AfD leader Alice Weidel breaks a political taboo in Germany, indicating a willingness to engage with extremist factions.\n\nAnalysts suggest that while Vance's actions might not directly influence the German elections or prompt the ruling parties to ally with the AfD, they reflect a broader objective of the U.S. right under Trump to support populist movements across Europe that align with their isolationist and anti-immigration stances. Leaders like Hungary's Viktor Orbán and Italy's Giorgia Meloni are seen as allies in this mission.\n\nVance’s strategy indicates a dismissal of traditional diplomatic protocols, as he avoided meeting with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, implying a shift in priorities towards populism and voter sentiment over established alliances. This approach mirrors Trump's tendency to redefine global relationships based on electoral mandates rather than historical diplomatic ties.\n\nThe involvement of U.S. politicians in European far-right politics raises questions about potential policy implications and the nature of future U.S.-European relations, hinting at significant changes that could disrupt the political landscape."},{"title":"OpenAI rejects $97.4bn Musk bid and says company is not for sale","content":"OpenAI has rejected a $97.4 billion bid from a consortium led by Elon Musk, stating that the company is not for sale.

He described what he termed a “backslide away from conscience rights” in the UK, citing the case of Adam Smith-Conner, who was convicted for silently praying near an abortion clinic, implying that this indicates an erosion of basic liberties. However, the facts detail that Smith-Conner was convicted after refusing to leave the area despite warnings, and the law in question was designed to prevent harassment near clinics.\n\nIn Scotland, Vance claimed that citizens were warned that private prayer in their homes could violate new laws around abortion clinic safety zones. This was fact-checked and found to be incorrect, as the Scottish government clarified that private prayer at home does not break the law unless it causes alarm to others.\n\nRegarding Romania, Vance referenced comments about the annulment of an election, suggesting a shift in democratic standards. This was linked to a Romanian court's decision based on concerns over electoral integrity, rather than any EU interference in elections.\n\nVance also addressed the EU’s Digital Services Act, claiming it allowed for social media shutdowns during civil unrest. While the EU does have powers to restrict platforms in urgent situations, such actions must follow due process, contrary to Vance's portrayal.\n\nIn Sweden, claims related to the conviction of a Christian activist involved in Qur'an burning led to misunderstandings about free speech protections, with Vance suggesting Sweden's laws suppressed free expression more than intended.\n\nFinally, Vance's comments about a recent car attack in Munich attributed blame to asylum seekers and linked it to broader security issues in Europe, drawing a connection that lacks substantiated evidence.\n\nThese statements reveal a broader narrative streamlining the discourse around perceived threats to rights and freedoms in Europe, yet many claims fail to align with the actual legal contexts and circumstances as outlined in factual analyses."},{"title":"PDC warns fans after crowd disrupts Premier League Darts night in Glasgow","content":"The Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) has issued a warning to fans following a disruptive incident during a Premier League Darts night in Glasgow.

The tribunal concluded that the three unlawful aspects of the APT rules, in place from December 2021 to November 2024, could not be separated from the entire set of rules, thus rendering the APT rules as a whole invalid.\n\nAs a consequence, this ruling raises uncertainties about the Premier League's regulatory framework, especially since the league had already postponed the introduction of new squad cost control measures. Meanwhile, the Premier League has drafted a new set of APT rules that are not directly impacted by the judgment, and the league believes these are valid. \n\nHowever, Manchester City has challenged these new rules, with further adjudication expected. Should these new rules also be found unenforceable, it could lead to a crisis of confidence in the league's governance during a crucial time, as there are 130 disciplinary charges pending against City and ongoing discussions about establishing an independent regulator for the league."},{"title":"WHO calls for cigarette-style cancer warnings on alcohol packaging","content":"The World Health Organization (WHO) has called for cigarette-style warning labels on alcohol packaging, stating that such labels would inform consumers about the increased cancer risks associated with alcohol consumption.

The WHO emphasizes that empowering individuals with this information strengthens their ability to make informed decisions about alcohol consumption.\n\nHowever, the Portman Group, which represents UK alcohol producers, argues that the warning labels would be an excessive measure and could lead to unnecessary anxiety among consumers. The UK's Department of Health has no plans to introduce such labels but is focusing on prevention and treatment for alcohol-related issues."},{"title":"The week around the world in 20 pictures","content":"The week around the world in 20 pictures includes:\n\n1.

Traditionally, ads are often overlooked, but the recent emphasis on AI in commercials suggests companies are attempting to reshape public perception of AI as beneficial and friendly, rather than ominous.\n\nThe article notes how ads for AI products have featured celebrities like Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson, who promote AI as something that will help in mundane tasks rather than cause disruption. However, this presents a contradiction since many in the entertainment industry, including actors, are actively voicing concerns about AI's impact on their livelihoods.\n\nDespite the cheerful commercial narratives, there remains a palpable unease about AI among the public, with surveys indicating that many believe AI will do more harm than good. The article critiques the ad campaigns as attempts at reputation management rather than genuine excitement for technological advancement, leading to a potential backlash against overly simplified portrayals of AI's implications.\n\nIn summary, AI has made a significant appearance in advertising, but the reality of its societal impact complicates the narrative presented by these ads."},{"title":"Chloe Kelly finds her smile with second Arsenal career ready to launch","content":"Chloe Kelly is excited to restart her career at Arsenal after a challenging period at Manchester City. Following a frustrating situation where she made only one start due to being sidelined, Kelly publicly expressed her feelings about City controlling her potential transfers. This led to a loan move to Arsenal, the club she left at 20. She feels relieved and has regained her smile, stating that she’s ready to move forward and showcase her abilities. \n\nKelly emphasized the mental toll of her previous situation but is now focused on training and earning her spot in the England squad for the upcoming Euros. She is eligible to play for Arsenal after a brief wait post-transfer and is eager to return to the pitch, especially in a significant matchup like the north London derby against Tottenham. Kelly's passion for the game remains strong, as she aims to create cherished memories at the Emirates Stadium and contribute significantly to her new team."},{"title":"Mickalene Thomas and Linder review – impossibly exuberant women electrify a body-slam of a show","content":"Mickalene Thomas and Linder's exhibitions at the Hayward Gallery showcase vibrant explorations of femininity and representation. Thomas’s work features monumental portraits of black women adorned with rhinestones, emphasizing their individuality and agency, contrasting their often marginal depictions in art history. Her pieces draw on joy and sorrow, using elements like glitter and sound to engage viewers and provoke reflection.\n\nLinder, known for her photocollages, presents a more surgical approach that critiques feminine imagery and societal norms through striking visual juxtapositions, blending elements of punk and feminism. Both artists, though stylistically different, share a common goal of dissecting and reclaiming female identity in their respective works.\n\nTogether, these exhibitions create a dynamic conversation about love, identity, and representation, celebrating the complexities of women's experiences."},{"title":"No Other Land film-makers denounce Trump’s Gaza plan: ‘A crazy thing’","content":"Film-makers Yuval Abraham and Basel Adra, known for their Oscar-nominated documentary \"No Other Land,\" have publicly criticized Donald Trump’s recent Gaza plan, which they interpret as a proposal for ethnic cleansing. Trump suggested that the U.S. should control Gaza, presenting it as a development project aimed at transforming the area into a prime location. This statement has drawn widespread condemnation, including from over 350 rabbis and industry members. \n\nAbraham described Trump’s remarks as “irresponsible” and “immoral,” while Adra labeled them as \"insane\" and indicative of a power dynamic where Trump feels he faces no repercussions. They emphasized the legality issues surrounding the displacement of Palestinians and the transfer of Israeli populations into occupied territories.\n\nDespite its acclaim, including an award at the Berlin Film Festival, \"No Other Land\" struggled to find distribution in the U.S. due, as Abraham suggests, to political reasons. The film addresses the displacement of Palestinians in the West Bank, specifically in Masafer Yatta, and is now being independently screened in nearly 100 theaters. \n\nOverall, the film-makers express their commitment to raise awareness about the plight of Palestinians, especially in light of the ongoing conflict and humanitarian crisis."},{"title":"‘Crystal Methodist’ fails to show for Manchester sentencing hearing","content":"A judge issued an arrest warrant for Paul Flowers, the former Methodist minister and ex-chairman of the Co-operative Bank, after he failed to attend a sentencing hearing for fraud in Manchester. Flowers, 74, had pleaded guilty to fraud charges totaling £100,000, related to his abuse of power as the executor of a woman's will. He became known as the \"Crystal Methodist\" after being caught on video buying illegal drugs in 2013. The judge noted that Flowers had disengaged from his legal team and cited mental health issues, but emphasized that a custodial sentence was likely due to the serious nature of the offenses involving a vulnerable victim. Flowers previously faced legal troubles, including drug possession and inappropriate conduct as a financial leader, leading to his ban from the financial services industry."},{"title":"British Paralympian is first person with physical disability cleared for space mission","content":"John McFall, a 46-year-old British Paralympian and orthopedic surgeon, has made history as the first person with a physical disability cleared for a space mission, specifically to the International Space Station (ISS). Following an extensive feasibility study by the European Space Agency (ESA), McFall was certified to undertake long-duration missions that can last up to six months.\n\nMcFall, who lost his right leg above the knee due to a motorcycle accident at the age of 19, aims to shift societal perceptions regarding disabilities, advocating for people to \"assume capability\" rather than making assumptions based on disability. He expressed pride not only in his achievement but in the mindset change it represents.\n\nHis journey to this certification began when he joined ESA's reserve astronaut corps in November 2022, with the goal of assessing whether a lower limb amputee could participate in space missions. By the end of 2024, the feasibility study confirmed there were no barriers to his participation, leading to his certification as an astronaut capable of flying to the ISS.\n\nMcFall emphasized the importance of acknowledging his capabilities rather than questioning them, countering the label \"parastronaut,\" which he feels creates an unnecessary distinction. His certification was positively received by ESA's international partners, reflecting a progressive stance on diversity and inclusion in space exploration. However, as a reserve member, he is not guaranteed a specific mission assignment."},{"title":"Pic D’Orhy well placed to end Nicholls’ longest lean streak in 20 years","content":"Paul Nicholls, after a year without a Grade One winner, has a strong opportunity to break this streak with Pic D’Orhy in the Ascot Chase. The event, scheduled for Saturday, comes as Nicholls aims for his 148th Grade One victory. Pic D’Orhy has an impressive record at Ascot, winning 4 out of 5 chases and performing well over the necessary distance. He previously competed at Cheltenham but did not fare well, which could factor into his performance. Competitors like L’Homme Presse and Corbetts Cross pose challenges, but Pic D’Orhy’s favorable conditions position him as the 7-4 favorite to secure a win and restore confidence to Nicholls' stable."},{"title":"‘Butter is a perception’: inside the UK’s first plant-based Michelin-starred restaurant","content":"Kirk Haworth, owner and head chef of Plates, the first plant-based Michelin-starred restaurant in the UK, expresses disdain for the term \"vegan,\" emphasizing that his approach to cooking is not a trend but a fundamental part of his identity. The restaurant, located in east London, has quickly gained popularity, receiving overwhelming demand since its opening, coinciding with Haworth’s television success.\n\nPlates features a tasting menu devoid of traditional dairy and meat products, innovatively replacing them with plant-based alternatives. Notable dishes include a slow-cooked leek treatment paired with frozen verjus and a lasagna made from mung and urad beans, challenging diners' perceptions of what vegetarian food can be. The restaurant emphasizes experience over imitation, avoiding the labels often associated with plant diets.\n\nThe ambiance of Plates is designed to be both casual and refined, with a semi-open kitchen and thoughtfully arranged décor. The dining experience is marked by theatrical presentations, including at-table sauce pouring. While the price point may feel steep for a meatless meal, the destination nature of the restaurant attracts a diverse clientele, many of whom are not vegan.\n\nDespite the evolving Michelin rating system, gaining a star is a significant achievement, especially for plant-based cuisine. Haworth acknowledges the challenges of the current food system and credits his dietary shift to health issues. Nonetheless, he notes that the majority of his customers are not vegan, signaling a shift in dining trends and openness to plant-based options."},{"title":"Doctor tells London inquest of ‘feelings of betrayal’ after son’s sepsis death","content":"A London inquest heard from Dr. Deborah Burns, a consultant paediatrician, about her profound sense of betrayal following the death of her son, William Hewes, from sepsis at Homerton hospital in January 2023. Burns recounted witnessing multiple medical errors and having to request antibiotics eight times before they were administered, significantly delaying critical treatment. She expressed her heartbreak and the aftermath of this loss, which has left her unable to work at the hospital where she had dedicated over 20 years.\n\nThe inquest revealed that William, a 22-year-old student, was not given necessary antibiotics until 1:25 AM despite his dire condition. Dr. Burns highlighted that during his treatment, medical staff failed to monitor him properly and there were significant delays in transferring him to intensive care. Dr. Ron Daniels, an intensive care consultant, testified that timely intervention could have potentially saved William's life, estimating that many young adults in similar conditions would survive with prompt treatment.\n\nThe inquest continues as questions arise about the reliability of the care William received and whether earlier actions could have altered the tragic outcome."},{"title":"Rollback on diversity policies ‘risks undoing decades of progress’, says Co-op","content":"The CEO of the Co-op group has expressed concerns that a rollback on diversity initiatives in the UK could reverse decades of progress. This statement comes as several US companies, including Amazon and Disney, are abandoning diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies in response to the Trump administration's actions to roll back anti-discrimination measures. Shirine Khoury-Haq emphasized that rolling back DEI is not just a business choice, but has significant real-world implications, fostering inequality and eroding trust.\n\nIn the UK, some firms, like BT, have reportedly scaled back their DEI initiatives, prompting worry among industry leaders. Khoury-Haq lamented the rapid withdrawal from diversity efforts, questioning if those companies were ever truly committed. The UK equalities minister affirmed that the government remains dedicated to addressing racial inequality and fostering diversity.\n\nRecent research indicates a strong business case for gender and ethnic diversity in corporate leadership. Industry figures have voiced fears that deemphasizing DEI could lead to detrimental effects on company culture and performance. The Co-op has implemented various initiatives aimed at promoting inclusivity, countering the narrative that diversity is somehow a drawback.\n\nOverall, Khoury-Haq and other advocates argue that businesses must continue to support DEI efforts, especially in light of socioeconomic challenges facing many individuals in the UK."}];
