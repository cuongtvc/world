The case was dismissed with prejudice in federal court, meaning it cannot be refiled. Tony Buzbee, her attorney, chose not to comment on the dismissal.\n\nJay-Z denied the allegations, declaring the lawsuit to be without merit and emphasizing the emotional distress it caused his family. Combs, currently in jail facing other serious criminal charges, also maintains his innocence regarding the accusations and plans to continue fighting against what his legal team describes as baseless claims. The lawsuit was the only one naming Jay-Z as a defendant and alleged an incident at a 2000 MTV Video Music Awards afterparty, claiming it led to significant personal trauma for the plaintiff."},{"title":"Southport killer’s sentence will not be referred to court of appeal","content":"The attorney general has announced that the sentence of Axel Rudakubana, the Southport killer, will not be referred to the court of appeal under the unduly lenient sentence scheme. Rudakubana received a 52-year minimum sentence for the murder of three girls during a dance class, which is the second-longest sentence in English legal history. Despite criticism from the families of victims and political figures who deemed the sentence too lenient, the attorney general concluded that no substantial legal basis existed to challenge the sentence. Calls for legislative changes to allow for whole-life orders for offenders under 18 were noted, as Rudakubana was 17 at the time of the crime. Previous referrals to anti-terror programs concerning Rudakubana's behavior were also mentioned, highlighting issues with the handling of his case prior to the attack."},{"title":"Sudoku 6,796 expert","content":"Sudoku 6,796 expert is a puzzle that requires players to fill a 9x9 grid with numbers so that each row, column, and each 3x3 box contains the digits 1 to 9 without repetition.

At a conference in Munich, Vance criticized Germany's current government just before elections where the far-right AfD party is expected to perform strongly. His meeting with AfD leader Alice Weidel breaks a political taboo in Germany, indicating a willingness to engage with extremist factions.\n\nAnalysts suggest that while Vance's actions might not directly influence the German elections or prompt the ruling parties to ally with the AfD, they reflect a broader objective of the U.S. right under Trump to support populist movements across Europe that align with their isolationist and anti-immigration stances. Leaders like Hungary's Viktor Orbán and Italy's Giorgia Meloni are seen as allies in this mission.\n\nVance’s strategy indicates a dismissal of traditional diplomatic protocols, as he avoided meeting with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, implying a shift in priorities towards populism and voter sentiment over established alliances. This approach mirrors Trump's tendency to redefine global relationships based on electoral mandates rather than historical diplomatic ties.\n\nThe involvement of U.S. politicians in European far-right politics raises questions about potential policy implications and the nature of future U.S.-European relations, hinting at significant changes that could disrupt the political landscape."},{"title":"OpenAI rejects $97.4bn Musk bid and says company is not for sale","content":"OpenAI has rejected a $97.4 billion bid from a consortium led by Elon Musk, stating that the company is not for sale. This bid is Musk's latest effort to disrupt OpenAI, a startup he co-founded but left behind, which has since developed a for-profit arm attracting significant funding. OpenAI asserts that any potential changes to its organization will enhance its nonprofit goals, ensuring that artificial general intelligence (AGI) benefits all of humanity. The response follows an exchange between OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman and Musk, culminating in Musk's lawyers claiming the bid would be withdrawn if OpenAI abandons its for-profit plans. Tensions between Musk and Altman have persisted since Musk's exit from the company in 2019, with Musk expressing concerns that OpenAI has strayed from its original mission."},{"title":"New Derby manager John Eustace off to awful start with thrashing by QPR","content":"John Eustace's debut as Derby's manager was disastrous, with the team suffering a 4-0 defeat to QPR. Ilias Chair scored twice, while Koki Saito and Ronnie Edwards also found the net, leading to a painful introduction for Eustace in his new role. He recently left Blackburn, a promotion contender, for Derby, a club now struggling in the relegation zone.\n\nDespite a promising start, Derby's momentum changed after conceding an early goal. Eustace's team failed to defend effectively, leading to further goals for QPR. Post-match, Eustace expressed disappointment but showed optimism about improving the team's confidence and performance. Meanwhile, QPR manager Martí Cifuentes praised his team's commitment and highlighted Chair's exceptional form."},{"title":"David Moyes believes Everton’s new owners ‘want to spend’ on rebuild","content":"David Moyes is optimistic about Everton's future under new ownership, believing that The Friedkin Group is eager to spend money on rebuilding the club. Following a meeting with the owners, Moyes shared that they are committed to moving past Everton's troubled history and strategically enhancing the team's competitiveness in the Premier League. He emphasized that while there is a desire to invest in new players, progress might be gradual, as many current players will be out of contract this summer.

He believes that patience is essential, especially considering Ferguson's past struggles and the need for young players to find their rhythm over time. The goal is to provide Ferguson with the opportunity to showcase his skills and contribute effectively to the team, relying on their established working relationship for support."},{"title":"Funboys review – some of the most fearless comedy in years","content":"\"Funboys\" is described as an utterly idiosyncratic sitcom set in a small town in Northern Ireland, showcasing fearless comedy reminiscent of \"This Country,\" but with notably more outrageous moments, such as a shocking masturbation scene on a pedalo. Created by Ryan Dylan and Rian Lennon, who also star in it, \"Funboys\" follows three emotionally stunted twentysomethings navigating their lives, relationships, and frustrations in the quaint town of Ballymacnoose.\n\nThe central characters—Callum, Jordan, and Lorcan—confront changing dynamics when an English girl named Gemma shakes up their group. The series explores themes of modern masculinity, as each character handles personal insecurities and societal expectations in their idiosyncratic ways.\n\nWhile the humor may not appeal to everyone due to its blend of charm and brutality, those who appreciate a gentle yet harrowing and insidious comedic style will likely find \"Funboys\" resonant. The show aired on BBC One and is now available on iPlayer."},{"title":"Mitoma and Minteh’s magic inspires Brighton to emphatic win over Chelsea","content":"Brighton secured an emphatic 3-0 victory over Chelsea, with standout performances from Kaoru Mitoma and Yankuba Minteh.

Accompanying her is her daughter Sofia, played by Emma Mackey, who embarks on a sexual awakening while grappling with her mother's challenges.\n\nThe film intricately weaves themes of emotional pain, trauma, and sexual exploration, juxtaposing Sofia's encounters with a free-spirited woman named Ingrid against Rose's medical struggles. Shaw's performance provides a fierce anchor amidst the film's ambiguous narrative, which sometimes risks drifting into absurdity. Overall, the film balances eroticism and family dynamics, with compelling performances that keep the story engaging. It premiered at the Berlin Film Festival."},{"title":"JD Vance breaks taboo by meeting with leader of Germany’s far-right party","content":"JD Vance, the US vice-president, recently met with Alice Weidel, the leader of Germany's far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party, marking a significant break from traditional political norms in Germany. The meeting, which took place in Munich, involved discussions about the war in Ukraine, German politics, and the barriers preventing ultra-nationalist parties like the AfD from participating in governing coalitions.\n\nThis meeting comes ahead of German elections where the AfD is expected to perform strongly amid rising anti-establishment sentiments. Vance's engagement with Weidel follows previous controversies, including remarks made by Elon Musk, who has publicly supported the AfD. Notably, Vance did not meet with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, suggesting a strategic alignment with far-right factions in Europe rather than established political leaders.\n\nVance's comments at the Munich Security Conference criticized European leaders for avoiding engagement with far-right parties, further fueling tensions between the US and its European allies. Scholz responded firmly, citing historical lessons from National Socialism as a reason for maintaining a consensus against extremist parties. The reception of Vance’s remarks in Germany was largely negative, with various officials condemning his comparisons of Europe to authoritarian regimes.

Despite holding 71% possession, they went into the break trailing 2-0.\n\nThe second half saw Chelsea attempting to apply pressure but failing to create significant opportunities, while Brighton's defense held firm.

This action fulfills a campaign promise and coincides with other initiatives aimed at addressing various healthcare and energy policies within his administration. The order has sparked controversy among Democrats and advocacy groups, leading to condemnations and legal challenges against Trump's decisions, including restrictions on healthcare for transgender youth. Additionally, the Trump administration is reportedly undergoing significant workforce reductions within federal agencies, igniting further criticism over its handling of public health and regulatory oversight."},{"title":"Rwandan-backed M23 rebels enter Bukavu in eastern DRC","content":"Rwandan-backed M23 rebels have entered Bukavu, the capital of South Kivu province in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, following a rapid advance from the north. They have taken control of significant areas, including the Kazingu and Bagira zones, with ongoing gunfire reported as they move towards the city center. The city, home to about 1 million people, has seen many businesses close and civilians flee due to fear of escalating violence.\n\nIn the days leading up to this, the rebels seized control of the Kavumu airport and captured other strategic locations, including Kabamba and Katana along the N2 road. The M23 group's recent advances culminated after seizing Goma, the capital of North Kivu, in January. Concerns over the humanitarian situation have intensified, with a reported 350,000 people now displaced due to the conflict.\n\nThe conflict in eastern DRC has historical roots in ethnic tensions and involves various armed groups, with the M23 notably being supported by Rwanda, which claims to be targeting extremist groups. However, international reports suggest that Rwanda is exploiting mineral resources through these groups.\n\nThe situation has drawn international attention, with calls for de-escalation and support for the Congolese government, now represented by Prime Minister Judith Suminwa Tuluka at the African Union summit, while President Félix Tshisekedi is abroad seeking assistance. The fighting has resulted in significant civilian casualties, most recently highlighted by the murder of a popular Congolese singer, raising further concerns about the safety of civilians amid the unrest."},{"title":"Manchester United to brief staff on ‘media reports’ of redundancies","content":"Manchester United is set to hold a team briefing on February 24 to address \"media reports\" concerning potential redundancies, expected to involve up to 200 job cuts. This follows previous layoffs of 250 staff over the past year. The briefing comes amidst financial struggles, with the club reportedly losing £300 million in the last three years, leading to concerns over its financial stability. The club has notified employees of the meeting through email, indicating that while no final decisions have been made, discussions will include the need for cost reductions and revenue increases.\n\nHead coach Ruben Amorim has stated that the club needs to sell players before being able to make new signings due to financial constraints. He emphasized that focusing on winning current games is paramount despite budgetary challenges. Manchester United is currently positioned 13th in the league and is preparing for a match against Tottenham, with several players potentially sidelined due to injury."},{"title":"Luxury London hotel Chiltern Firehouse evacuated after fire breaks out","content":"A fire broke out at the Chiltern Firehouse, a luxury hotel and restaurant in London, leading to the evacuation of around 100 people on Friday afternoon. The London Fire Brigade dispatched 125 firefighters and 20 fire engines to tackle the blaze, which was reported to have originated in the kitchen and spread upwards through ducting to the roof. By 5:30 PM, thick black smoke was visible, prompting firefighters to use an aerial platform to extinguish the fire. The cause of the fire is still under investigation. The venue, known for its celebrity clientele, has been a hotspot for high-profile guests since its opening in 2014."},{"title":"Mary and the Hyenas review – patchy ode to Wollstonecraft and women ‘howling at the world’","content":"\"Mary and the Hyenas\" is a musical tribute to Mary Wollstonecraft, exploring her legacy as a pioneer of feminist thought. While the production aims to evoke Wollstonecraft's radical spirit through fast-paced scenes and a lively score, it suffers from a disjointed narrative and emotional monotony. Directed by Esther Richardson, the play features a blend of styles reminiscent of mid-20th-century theatre but often lacks tonal variety and character depth. The first half is critiqued for being overly intense without enough emotional range, while the second half brings more substance but still struggles with its revolutionary messaging. Overall, the production is described as a \"patchy ode\" that fails to fully engage with its subject matter. It will run at Hull Truck theatre until March 1 and then at Wilton’s Music Hall in London later in March."},{"title":"‘Thought crime’ and cancelled elections: how do JD Vance’s claims about Europe stand up?","content":"JD Vance, speaking at the Munich Security Conference, made several controversial claims regarding the state of rights and freedoms in Europe, particularly focusing on the UK, Scotland, Romania, and other nations. He described what he termed a “backslide away from conscience rights” in the UK, citing the case of Adam Smith-Conner, who was convicted for silently praying near an abortion clinic, implying that this indicates an erosion of basic liberties. However, the facts detail that Smith-Conner was convicted after refusing to leave the area despite warnings, and the law in question was designed to prevent harassment near clinics.\n\nIn Scotland, Vance claimed that citizens were warned that private prayer in their homes could violate new laws around abortion clinic safety zones. This was fact-checked and found to be incorrect, as the Scottish government clarified that private prayer at home does not break the law unless it causes alarm to others.\n\nRegarding Romania, Vance referenced comments about the annulment of an election, suggesting a shift in democratic standards. This was linked to a Romanian court's decision based on concerns over electoral integrity, rather than any EU interference in elections.\n\nVance also addressed the EU’s Digital Services Act, claiming it allowed for social media shutdowns during civil unrest. While the EU does have powers to restrict platforms in urgent situations, such actions must follow due process, contrary to Vance's portrayal.\n\nIn Sweden, claims related to the conviction of a Christian activist involved in Qur'an burning led to misunderstandings about free speech protections, with Vance suggesting Sweden's laws suppressed free expression more than intended.\n\nFinally, Vance's comments about a recent car attack in Munich attributed blame to asylum seekers and linked it to broader security issues in Europe, drawing a connection that lacks substantiated evidence.\n\nThese statements reveal a broader narrative streamlining the discourse around perceived threats to rights and freedoms in Europe, yet many claims fail to align with the actual legal contexts and circumstances as outlined in factual analyses."},{"title":"PDC warns fans after crowd disrupts Premier League Darts night in Glasgow","content":"The Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) has issued a warning to fans following a disruptive incident during a Premier League Darts night in Glasgow. Spectators whistled and booed as players took their turns, prompting the PDC to state that anyone behaving inappropriately could be removed from the venue. The disturbances affected matches, including the semi-final featuring Gerwyn Price, who was heckled, and the final where Luke Littler defeated Luke Humphries amidst ongoing crowd noise. The PDC emphasized that such behavior is unacceptable and aims to maintain a positive atmosphere for players and fans alike. The next event is scheduled in Dublin on February 20."},{"title":"Zelenskyy tells Vance Ukraine needs ‘security guarantees’ before any Putin talks","content":"During a recent meeting in Munich, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy emphasized the necessity for \"security guarantees\" from the United States and a joint US-Ukrainian peace plan before engaging in negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin to resolve the ongoing war in Ukraine. The discussion with US Vice President JD Vance, lasting about an hour, ended without concrete announcements regarding a critical minerals deal, aimed at garnering American support for Ukraine.\n\nZelenskyy expressed reassurance after the meeting, feeling he had managed to shape the Trump administration’s approach more collaboratively, especially following concerns about premature concessions made by Trump to Putin. He described Putin as a liar and stated that all topics would be on the table in any future discussions with him.\n\nBoth leaders acknowledged that more talks are needed to establish a common understanding. Vance, accompanied by other US officials, did not disclose specific details about the peace plan, indicating a desire to keep options open for negotiators.\n\nEuropean leaders were reportedly reassured by the US that Ukraine would be consulted in any future peace talks and that its sovereignty would be upheld. They expressed frustration over statements from US officials that suggested Ukraine might have to give up territory and wouldn’t join NATO, prompting calls for unity in support of Ukraine.\n\nZelenskyy's comments also indicated a need for Europe to strengthen military support for Ukraine. He warned of potential Russian troop buildups aimed at European attacks. His government seeks strong security guarantees and increased military aid from allies to ensure Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity."},{"title":"Premier League sponsorship rules declared void in win for Manchester City","content":"A recent tribunal ruling has declared the Premier League's sponsorship rules related to associated party transactions (APTs) as \"void and unenforceable.\" This decision is a significant victory for Manchester City in their ongoing battle with the league. The tribunal concluded that the three unlawful aspects of the APT rules, in place from December 2021 to November 2024, could not be separated from the entire set of rules, thus rendering the APT rules as a whole invalid.\n\nAs a consequence, this ruling raises uncertainties about the Premier League's regulatory framework, especially since the league had already postponed the introduction of new squad cost control measures. Meanwhile, the Premier League has drafted a new set of APT rules that are not directly impacted by the judgment, and the league believes these are valid. \n\nHowever, Manchester City has challenged these new rules, with further adjudication expected. Should these new rules also be found unenforceable, it could lead to a crisis of confidence in the league's governance during a crucial time, as there are 130 disciplinary charges pending against City and ongoing discussions about establishing an independent regulator for the league."},{"title":"WHO calls for cigarette-style cancer warnings on alcohol packaging","content":"The World Health Organization (WHO) has called for cigarette-style warning labels on alcohol packaging, stating that such labels would inform consumers about the increased cancer risks associated with alcohol consumption. The recommendation aims to tackle the widespread unawareness that alcohol causes at least seven types of cancer, including breast and bowel cancer. Cancer charities support this initiative, highlighting the need for clear health warnings to enhance public awareness.\n\nCurrently, some countries, such as Ireland, plan to implement these warnings, while others, like France and Lithuania, already label alcohol concerning pregnancy risks. The WHO emphasizes that empowering individuals with this information strengthens their ability to make informed decisions about alcohol consumption.\n\nHowever, the Portman Group, which represents UK alcohol producers, argues that the warning labels would be an excessive measure and could lead to unnecessary anxiety among consumers. The UK's Department of Health has no plans to introduce such labels but is focusing on prevention and treatment for alcohol-related issues."},{"title":"The week around the world in 20 pictures","content":"The week around the world in 20 pictures includes:\n\n1.

The slogan \"Altadena is not for sale\" has emerged as a rallying cry, emphasizing a collective desire among community members to rebuild without the influence of developers seeking to capitalize on the disaster.\n\nMany locals, including those who lost their homes, have received unsolicited offers from developers while still reeling from the destruction. Community leaders, like Brandon Lamar, highlight the importance of enabling displaced residents to return and rebuild, pushing against price gouging in the housing market.\n\nThe reinstatement of Black homeownership in Altadena is crucial, as nearly half of the Black households were devastated by the fires. Discussions among community members emphasize a commitment to keeping the neighborhood affordable and accessible, resisting the pressures of \"climate gentrification,\" which threatens to drive prices up following disasters. Economic challenges, including soaring rebuilding costs and the influence of wealthy developers, complicate the community's recovery efforts.\n\nCommunity rallies are being organized to foster solidarity and solutions, including proposals for land trusts to help local families retain ownership of properties. As rebuilding begins, residents face the question of whether to stay or sell, with uncertainty about future wildfire risks complicating their decisions. The enduring spirit of Altadena's diverse community and its fight to retain cultural integrity remains a focal point amidst the challenges posed by the wildfire’s aftermath."},{"title":"Ex-soldier denies he tried to manipulate junior colleague found dead at barracks","content":"An inquest is examining the death of 19-year-old Royal Artillery Gunner Jaysley Beck, who was found dead at Larkhill camp in Wiltshire on December 15, 2021. During the proceedings, ex-soldier Bdr Ryan Mason, who was Beck's senior line manager, denied accusations of manipulating her. He was reported to have sent Beck approximately 3,600 messages in November 2021 alone, leading her to describe him as \"psychotic and possessive.\"\n\nMason, now a driving instructor, stated that he did not aim to manipulate Beck, despite being questioned about whether he threatened self-harm to coerce her into a closer relationship. He declined to answer some questions pertaining to their interactions but denied asking Beck to sleep with him during a hotel event. In a message read during the inquest, Beck expressed feeling \"trapped\" and uncomfortable due to Mason's behavior, noting a toll on her mental health.\n\nMason, who left the army shortly before Beck's death, later displayed emotional distress during the hearing. The inquest is ongoing."},{"title":"The Guardian view on supporting vaccines: humans can work miracles – so why wouldn’t we? | Editorial","content":"The editorial from The Guardian emphasizes the crucial role of vaccination in improving global health, highlighting that it has significantly reduced child mortality by 59% from 1990 to 2022 and saved over 150 million lives since the WHO's Expanded Programme on Immunisation began in 1974. It calls for continued support for global vaccination initiatives, particularly the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (Gavi), amid funding cuts from the US and potential cuts from the UK.\n\nThe piece stresses that vaccination is not only cost-effective but also essential for preventing disease outbreaks exacerbated by climate change and conflicts. Despite historical successes, such as smallpox eradication and significant reductions in polio cases, the current climate of vaccine skepticism and financial cutbacks poses serious threats to immunization efforts. The editorial asserts that governments must prioritize support for vaccination programs to continue saving lives and fostering stability in poorer nations. It concludes by urging the UK to sustain its funding commitments to Gavi, advocating for the moral imperative to support life-saving vaccines."},{"title":"The Guardian view on film awards: and the winner is… | Editorial","content":"The Guardian's editorial on film awards discusses the relevance of separate categories for best actor and best actress in light of ongoing diversity issues in the film industry. While there are arguments for equalizing these categories to include all genders and promote inclusivity, the concern remains that merging these awards could lead to fewer nominations for women. The editorial highlights ongoing disparities, noting that historically, female directors and other roles in the industry have been severely underrepresented. It emphasizes the need for increased visibility and recognition of female artists, asserting that diversity should be better represented across all awards categories. The piece calls for a broader change within the film industry to ensure fair recognition of talent from all backgrounds."},{"title":"UFOs have earned a new name – and should be objects of serious study | Letters","content":"The letters discuss the growing interest in unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP), previously known as UFOs, emphasizing the need for serious academic study of these occurrences. Professor Michael Bohlander highlights that some sightings may relate to non-human intelligence (NHI), suggesting that understanding this could profoundly impact human perspectives.

James Latimer challenges the idea, noting that many accomplished female authors, such as NK Jemisin and Ann Leckie, have significantly contributed to the genre without writing primarily romantic or young adult fiction. He criticizes the misconception that fantasy is predominantly male-oriented and highlights the need to recognize female fantasy readers who appreciate a broad spectrum of fantasy, not just romantasy.\n\nYvonne Williams adds that the romantic fantasy (romantasy) trend is not new and references earlier works like Anne McCaffrey’s \"Dragonflight.\" She suggests that critics should be more inclusive and open-minded, as the genre evolves and garners commercial success among female audiences.

Initially, Ratcliffe aimed to leverage expertise across multiple sports through investments in teams like OGC Nice and Manchester United, promoting a plan to enhance their competitiveness. However, recent developments, such as legal action from New Zealand Rugby over missed sponsorship payments and a split with Sir Ben Ainslie's America’s Cup team, reflect significant challenges.\n\nWhile OGC Nice is performing relatively well in Ligue 1, these setbacks have cast doubts on Ineos's reliability as a sponsor and partner. Ratcliffe's strategic focus appears to have shifted towards more secure investments, particularly in Formula 1, where Ineos's involvement has been financially rewarding. \n\nConcerns grow over how these issues may impact Manchester United, particularly in a competitive football landscape that requires astute financial management. The article suggests that overextending across various sports could be detrimental, indicating that Ratcliffe's grand vision may not be sustainable under current conditions. As Ineos's credibility comes into question, the future of its sporting ambitions hangs in the balance."},{"title":"Vivienne Westwood fashion house faces questions over homophobic bullying claims against CEO","content":"The Vivienne Westwood fashion house is facing scrutiny following allegations of homophobic bullying against its CEO, Carlo D’Amario. An independent investigation upheld five allegations of misconduct, including the use of homophobic slurs and discriminatory language. The investigation revealed that D'Amario had a pattern of bullying behavior and had likely violated employment law. Despite the findings, D’Amario continues to lead the company and receives a considerable salary, while the employee who raised the allegations has left the organization.\n\nThe controversy gained traction after Cora Corré, Vivienne Westwood's granddaughter, resigned from the company, accusing D’Amario of misusing designs and contesting trademarks. The internal investigation included testimonies from staff who reported D’Amario's use of disparaging nicknames based on sexuality and derogatory comments about the company's LGBTQ+ representation. While some staff defended D’Amario, the investigator found enough evidence to suggest harassment under the Equality Act 2010.\n\nWestwood, recognized as an LGBT+ icon, has a company that professes strong values regarding equality and inclusivity, yet the investigation raises serious concerns about how these values are upheld within its leadership. The company's equality policies were noted as “excellent,” but there are questions about the effectiveness of their implementation, particularly among top executives who failed to complete required training on equality and diversity."},{"title":"Das Licht (The Light) review – mystical satirical romp channels German anxiety over refugees","content":"\"Das Licht (The Light)\" is a film directed by Tom Tykwer, presenting a mystical and satirical exploration of contemporary German anxieties surrounding refugees. The narrative centers on a troubled Berlin family whose lives are uplifted by a Syrian cleaner named Farrah, who embodies a magical, transformative presence, offering unconventional methods to tackle their depression.\n\nThe film runs for a lengthy two hours and 40 minutes, balancing moments of comedy and social commentary. The family, comprising Tim, a modern father played by Lars Eidinger, and his wife Milena, portrayed by Nicolette Krebitz, grapples with their privileged lifestyle as they navigate personal issues involving their teenage children, Frieda and Jon. The arrival of Farrah, after a comically dark incident with their previous cleaner, introduces a mystical element meant to catalyze emotional healing within the family.\n\nDespite its energetic premise and notable performances, the film is critiqued for its lack of coherent direction and an overreliance on pop culture references, notably Queen's \"Bohemian Rhapsody,\" which serves as a somewhat desperate attempt to inject life into the narrative. While \"Das Licht\" tackles significant themes, including the complexities of identity and the societal impact of migration, it ultimately struggles to deliver a cohesive message, leaving a sense of incompleteness in its exploration of these issues. The film screens at the Berlin film festival, capturing a moment of peculiar charm yet profound disarray in contemporary cinema."},{"title":"What is the DEI rollback and where will it spread next?","content":"The DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) rollback refers to a recent trend in which many U.S. corporations are reversing or overhauling their diversity and inclusion policies. This movement gained momentum after Donald Trump signed executive orders revoking DEI programs in the federal government, triggering similar actions in the private sector, particularly among major finance and tech companies like Goldman Sachs, Accenture, and Google. These firms have begun eliminating diversity hiring goals, career development programs for specific demographic groups, and even notable diversity observances.\n\nThe rollback is linked to a longstanding movement by rightwing activists who criticize DEI initiatives as \"reverse discrimination,” intensified by a 2023 Supreme Court ruling that ended affirmative action in college admissions. This alignment with rightwing agendas has led companies such as Walmart, McDonald’s, Ford, Amazon, and Meta to also modify their DEI initiatives.\n\nWhile the trend in the U.S. is evident, its impact on the UK is still evolving. Some U.S. companies operating in the UK have declared their commitment to maintain diversity initiatives, despite shifts in the U.S. landscape. Employment lawyers express concern that U.S. changes might influence practices in the UK, potentially leading to legal complications.\n\nTrade unions in the UK are apprehensive about multinational firms adopting Americanized rightwing policies and are urging for the continued need for robust diversity initiatives to address workplace inequalities. Despite the rollback, some UK firms remain committed to diversity, as they recognize the competitive advantage it brings in attracting younger talent.\n\nIn conclusion, the DEI rollback, originating from political shifts in the U.S., could spread further, impacting not just companies in the U.S. but potentially influencing their operations in the UK and beyond, despite ongoing resistance from some corporate leaders and labor unions."},{"title":"Ravneet Gill’s recipe for tapioca pudding with roast rhubarb | The sweet spot","content":"Ravneet Gill’s recipe for tapioca pudding with roast rhubarb offers a delightful twist on the traditional dessert.

The film's narrative, which includes a red-skinned supervillain attacking the White House, has sparked conservative backlash, labeling it a \"woke disaster.\"\n\nMackie's comments on the meaning of Captain America have further fueled criticism, particularly in the wake of rising political divides in the U.S. The character's history, created during WWII by Jewish writers, has always reflected American values and political realities. This latest film continues the trend of intertwining comic book narratives with contemporary issues, reflecting societal concerns about authority and morality.\n\nMoreover, the film's casting choices and plot elements have incited protests and calls for boycotts, particularly concerning the character Sabra, portrayed by Israeli actress Shira Haas, prompting allegations of promoting a politically contentious narrative.

The Roman Catholic Church had previously labeled her claims as fraudulent and tightened its guidelines on such phenomena. Following a fraud investigation initiated by prosecutors in 2023, lab results suggested that the blood on the statue came from Cardia, although her lawyer argued that this does not eliminate the possibility of supernatural involvement.

He couldn’t be more wrong | Melanie Brusseler","content":"Melanie Brusseler's article critiques Donald Trump's approach to trade with China, arguing that his strategy of antagonism will not revive the US economy as he believes. She highlights the illusion that tariffs can restore manufacturing jobs, noting that the US manufacturing sector has been in decline for decades and correlating this with China's rise as a manufacturing power. Brusseler asserts that tariffs serve as inflationary taxes on everyday Americans, potentially exacerbating economic issues rather than resolving them. Moreover, she points out that corporations might not reinvest surplus profits into manufacturing, further undermining the intended economic boost.\n\nThe article also examines the broader implications of Trump's trade war, suggesting that it diverts attention from necessary solutions to economic distress and reinforces reactionary politics based on nationalism and resentment. Brusseler contrasts Trump's aggressive trade policies with the more measured approach of the Biden administration, which sought to promote economic recovery through public investment and limited tariffs. She warns against moving towards anti-China trade policies at the expense of addressing fundamental socioeconomic issues facing Americans, suggesting that a focus on class issues, rather than trade wars, is crucial for meaningful economic reform."},{"title":"I tested the best thermal swimsuits for wild swimming.

An impact report on the forthcoming immigration law reveals that around 60,000 applicants could be denied permission to remain in France due to these stringent tests. The law, aimed at promoting foreign integration, raises the required proficiency level to that of an 11-15-year-old French student.\n\nInvestigation shows that five out of ten French nationals, including a highly educated literature student, failed the written portion of the tests. Educators argue that the tests set an unrealistic standard for many foreign nationals, and previous obligations for residency applicants are being tightened.\n\nThe law aligns with policies in neighboring countries and is seen as a move to encourage responsibility and integration among foreign residents. Critics, however, note that many individuals, regardless of their daily use of French, may still be unable to pass the exams due to their complexity.\n\nThe new legislation, passed in January 2024, is one of several measures reflected in a political shift to more stringent immigration controls under President Emmanuel Macron's government.

Recent analyses reveal that at the last conference of the ICAO's Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection (CAEP), industry delegates outnumbered representatives from environmental groups by a margin of ten to one. The ICAO and related events have been sponsored by major fossil fuel companies, leading critics to claim that the organization has been \"captured\" by these interests, thereby hindering effective action against aviation emissions.\n\nThe ICAO has faced criticism for its lack of transparency, as meeting documents are often not publicly accessible, and attendance at CAEP events is restricted. Independent experts argue that the ICAO's plans for reducing emissions are \"critically insufficient,\" and the anticipated growth in passenger numbers will likely exacerbate climate issues if not properly managed.\n\nCalls for increased transparency and accountability within the ICAO have been made, including from members of CAEP itself.

Trump recently offered political asylum to white South Africans, allegedly following a campaign by AfriForum that has pushed the narrative of “white genocide” and claimed that the South African government is targeting white farmers under new land reform laws. The article states that this is a misrepresentation of reality, as the new law aims at addressing historical inequalities from apartheid, and the majority of violence against farmers is not politically motivated.\n\nAfriForum has been active in lobbying the Trump administration, promoting false claims about white persecution while also assisting Elon Musk—who has expressed similar views—in trying to bypass South African affirmative action laws for his business interests. Musk's involvement partly stems from his upbringing in apartheid South Africa, which shapes his perspectives on race in the country. \n\nThe organization and its representatives have made numerous trips to the US to gain political support, framing their views on government policies as a defense of the Afrikaner minority against state-sponsored discrimination. The wider involvement of figures like Musk and connections with other tech billionaires raised in South Africa add to the narrative's prominence in American politics.\n\nOverall, the article highlights the convergence of right-wing rhetoric, misinformation about race relations in South Africa, and political lobbying by groups like AfriForum, which underscores a broader trend of aligning with nationalist and extremist views within US politics."},{"title":"‘No one wants to pay $25 for breakfast’: US restaurants are cracking under inflation","content":"US restaurants, particularly breakfast spots, are facing severe economic pressures due to soaring ingredient prices fueled by inflation. For instance, egg prices have doubled, impacting dishes that heavily rely on them, such as omelets and pancakes. Costs for other staples like coffee and orange juice have also surged, with coffee at a 47-year high linked to climate effects in producing countries.\n\nRestaurateurs are struggling to maintain affordable prices for customers already feeling the pinch from inflation, with experts noting a median price increase of 19% for popular breakfast items over the past year. Restaurant owners, like Stephen Slaughter of Green Eggs Cafe, are reluctant to raise prices significantly, fearing it will alienate loyal customers, especially since many dishes can no longer be produced as cost-effectively as before.\n\nWhile some eateries are innovating with different menu items to mitigate costs, the reliance on traditional breakfast foods and the accompanying price increases present a challenge. The competitive nature of the breakfast market, where restaurants traditionally thrive on high-volume sales of inexpensive dishes, is now being jeopardized.\n\nOverall, rising operational costs, coupled with consumer price sensitivity, raise concerns about the sustainability of profit margins in the breakfast restaurant sector.

After spending nearly two years in administration, the club was acquired by a consortium led by former Formula One team owner Eddie Jordan. However, the RFU is unlikely to grant the necessary license for the move, as it requires board approval, especially since no English club has previously been allowed to exit the league system in such a manner.\n\nThe team’s situation is complicated by past financial issues, resulting in significant funding from the RFU, which makes them hesitant to permit the transition to a competing league. The RFU also has concerns regarding the implications of the junior teams operating under the English system while the senior team competes in the URC.

While some predictions about teams and players were accurate, many turned out to be inaccurate. \n\nBefore the season, the writers expected strong performances from teams like the Jets, Colts, and Bears, but these teams struggled significantly. The Bills, initially doubted, performed well and reached the AFC Championship game. Patrick Mahomes was a predicted MVP, but Josh Allen won the award instead, with Mahomes' connection to key players faltering over the season. \n\nIn terms of rookies, expectations for Caleb Williams fell flat due to poor coaching and a high sack count, while Jayden Daniels emerged as a standout. The AFC divisions saw some surprises, with the Texans winning the South and the Rams claiming the West after the 49ers’ decline. \n\nUltimately, the Eagles shocked predictions by decisively defeating the Chiefs in the Super Bowl, highlighting that team completeness trumps individual star power and that the idea of inevitability in the NFL is misleading."},{"title":"That new land use policy that the Tories call ‘national suicide’?

Contrary to the accusations of imposing strict regulations, Dimbleby insists that the policy will provide better information and incentives for landowners to make sustainable decisions without coercion.\n\nDimbleby emphasizes the urgency of adopting this framework, likening the current situation to the post-World War II need for food security.

While it starts with an intriguing premise reminiscent of a pre-Covid era, the film quickly shifts focus to the romantic tension between the characters, reducing the monster threat to a backdrop for their flirtation.\n\nAs the story progresses, the characters communicate through written messages and engage in increasingly reckless romantic escapades, undermining their guard duties.

The backdrop to her commentary includes the recent release of an American teacher from Russian imprisonment, which contrasts starkly with the US government's approach to Ukraine under Trump's administration. \n\nHinsliff highlights the growing concern that the US, focusing on China and its own borders, is no longer prioritizing European security, effectively leaving Ukraine to negotiate its future with little support. She notes that Trump’s willingness to concede territory to Russia and exclude Ukraine from NATO is indicative of a broader shift in US foreign policy, which could have dire implications for European allies like Britain. \n\nThe piece emphasizes that this shift reveals Britain's own vulnerabilities, as its military reliance on the US may not be sustainable.

As part of a spending review, Chancellor Rachel Reeves has mandated that departments must justify how every programme aligns with key government priorities such as growth, net zero, crime, education, immigration, and the NHS. If they fail to make these connections, they risk losing funding. \n\nSources indicate that officials are often making dubious links between their spending and the government's main missions. For instance, the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology claimed that digitizing death records would boost growth by reducing queues at local councils. There are also claims that flood defenses and waste management directly contribute to economic growth.\n\nThe Treasury is looking at potential cuts of at least 1% annually to unprotected departments—those outside health and defense. As the Office for Budget Responsibility is expected to downgrade growth forecasts, cutting spending seems to be the only option for Reeves, who has ruled out major tax increases. Non-essential departments are being asked to model significant budget reductions as part of this process."},{"title":"How a young Dutch woman’s life began when she was allowed to die – podcast","content":"The podcast titled \"How a young Dutch woman’s life began when she was allowed to die\" explores the story of Zoë, who faced a decision about euthanasia due to her suffering.

Adult Misty is also grappling with her friendships, while unsettling dynamics re-emerge between other characters. Despite lingering questions about the overall plot coherence, the revival of humor and engaging storytelling creates an enjoyable viewing experience.
