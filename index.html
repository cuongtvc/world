Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, Vance criticized European leaders for perceived failures in upholding democracy and free speech, suggesting that they suppress alternative viewpoints. He expressed concern that freedom of speech is declining in Europe and questioned whether American values align with those of European leaders.\n\nIn reaction, Scholz asserted that Germany would not tolerate interventions in its democracy and emphasized the importance of rejecting cooperation with far-right political groups. He reiterated that Germany is a robust democracy, explicitly stating that extreme right elements should not be involved in political decision-making.\n\nScholz highlighted that free speech in Europe must adhere to laws that prohibit hate speech, a direct response to Vance's assertions regarding free speech in Europe. The exchange reflects growing tensions in transatlantic relations, amid diverse concerns over democracy, migration, and security in the context of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine."},{"title":"‘It seemed wrong to write about normal life after that horrendous election’: US novelist Anne Tyler","content":"US novelist Anne Tyler, at 83, reflects on her writing journey and the impact of recent political events on her work in an interview promoting her new novel, \"Three Days in June.\" Despite feeling a sense of shame for reaching her 25th book, Tyler describes her latest work as capturing the nuances of ordinary life, a theme central to her storytelling.\n\nKnown for her endearing characters and domestic settings, Tyler's novels like \"Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant\" and \"Breathing Lessons\" have made her a prominent figure in American literature. In this latest novel, she explores a long-divorced couple navigating their relationship during their daughter's wedding, weaving in the complexities of family and personal growth.\n\nTyler emphasizes her enduring curiosity about everyday human experiences and how people manage their lives amid difficulties. Although she has traditionally avoided political themes in her novels, she acknowledges that the recent political climate, particularly the 2016 election, has made it impossible to ignore such contexts. \"It seemed so wrong to have any character going about normal life after that horrendous election,\" she states, revealing her concern and disillusionment with the current state of affairs.\n\nIn her creative process, Tyler relies on an index card system to capture ideas, often years in advance, and maintains a meticulous writing routine. Despite personal losses and challenges, including her husband's death and her own health issues, she continues to craft her narratives, believing deeply in the resilience of ordinary people.\n\nTyler reflects on her upbringing and the influence it had on her writing, particularly the supportive male figures in her life.

Despite the intention behind trigger warnings to prepare audiences for potentially distressing content, Maltby highlights evidence from interviews and studies suggesting that these warnings can inadvertently heighten anxiety and physiological reactions, such as fainting among audience members.\n\nThe play, which is based on the works of Annie Ernaux, has garnered attention for its portrayal of female experiences, yet it has unintentionally been branded as \"the abortion play.\" Maltby references the experiences of the play's director, Eline Arbo, who noted that in performances without trigger warnings, there were fewer adverse reactions compared to those where warnings were prominently displayed.\n\nAdditionally, the article conveys that PTSD triggers are often unique to individual experiences and do not necessarily stem from content that aligns with one's past trauma. Maltby argues that by focusing on trigger warnings, the true essence of the narratives and the broader themes of the play may be overshadowed, ultimately complicating the audience's engagement with the material.\n\nMaltby concludes that while trigger warnings may help some individuals, they can also sensationalize the content and disrupt the storytelling, thereby detracting from the authentic experiences being conveyed on stage."},{"title":"Extreme weather expected to cause food price volatility in 2025 after cost of cocoa and coffee doubles","content":"Extreme weather is predicted to cause significant volatility in food prices throughout 2025, with cocoa and coffee prices having more than doubled recently—up 163% and 103%, respectively. Research by the consultancy Inverto indicates that rising temperatures and extreme weather events are hampering crop yields, leading to these price spikes. The year 2024 was recorded as the hottest on record, and this trend appears to persist into 2025, creating ongoing challenges for agriculture.\n\nIn addition to cocoa and coffee, the price of sunflower oil rose by 56% due to droughts impacting crop yields in Bulgaria and Ukraine, amongst other commodities experiencing sharp increases. Experts suggest that food manufacturers and retailers should diversify their supply chains to mitigate risks associated with over-dependence on specific regions.\n\nClimate scientists corroborate the findings, emphasizing that extreme weather will likely intensify, raising food security concerns. Examples include severe heat leading to price hikes in rice and vegetables in Asia, as well as impacts on grain pricing due to climate-related stressors affecting coffee and cocoa-producing countries. As long as greenhouse gas emissions remain unchecked, the agricultural sector is expected to face worsening challenges, contributing to ongoing food price increases."},{"title":"The Breakfast Club at 40: the teen movie blueprint for better or worse","content":"\"The Breakfast Club\" at 40: the teen movie blueprint for better or worse\n\nJohn Hughes’ 1985 film \"The Breakfast Club\" continues to resonate as a significant cultural artifact four decades after its release. The film pioneered a style of storytelling about adolescents that highlighted their complex inner lives beyond typical high school stereotypes. It successfully filled a gap in the film industry for authentic representations of young people, contrasting sharply with both corny after-school specials and raunchy comedies of the time.\n\nDespite its impact, the film has faced recent scrutiny regarding its portrayal of relationships and themes, particularly in light of evolving societal norms. Molly Ringwald has voiced concerns about the dynamics between characters, suggesting that they reflect troubling aspects of culture rather than innocent flirtation, especially in relation to issues of consent and harassment.\n\nWhile critics acknowledge Hughes’ insightful take on teenage struggles, they also note its shortcomings, such as overgeneralizations and underdeveloped character arcs. The film wraps up with a sense of conventional happy endings that can undermine its earlier emotional truths, suggesting a conservative resolution that may overlook deeper issues of adolescence.\n\nIn retrospect, \"The Breakfast Club\" serves as both a nostalgic look at teen life and a reminder of its own flawed impulses. It set a template that others have followed, establishing themes of connection and understanding that remain relevant, though its execution invites critical examination amidst contemporary perspectives."},{"title":"How Manchester United are making big profits and huge losses at the same time","content":"Manchester United is currently facing a unique financial situation where the club is reporting both significant profits and substantial losses simultaneously. Recently, Sir Jim Ratcliffe's minority investment in the club was hailed as a positive development by fans. However, shortly thereafter, the club announced further job cuts and staff benefit reductions, which were attributed to the need to reduce costs amid financial difficulties.\n\nDespite predicting an Ebitda profit of £145-160 million for the year ending June 2025, the club has also disclosed over £300 million in pre-tax losses over the past three years. This duality arises from differing definitions of profit, often influenced by what stakeholders aim to convey—whether to investors or fans. A significant factor contributing to these losses is the club's heavy expenditure on player transfers, amounting to £2.1 billion since 2013, which has left them with substantial outstanding transfer fees, primarily owed to other clubs.\n\nAdditionally, operational costs remain high, with over £340 million in recent years on player amortisation and other expenses. This financial strain has been further exacerbated by the Glazer family's management decisions, including costs associated with the sale of shares to Ratcliffe, leading to mixed financial signals from a club that has historically been a financial powerhouse.\n\nWhile Manchester United continues to generate considerable revenue, criticisms arise around their approach to managing staff and costs, creating a complex narrative where the club must navigate both profit and loss amidst ongoing concerns from fans about financial sustainability and ownership."},{"title":"‘Rugby can be pretty complicated’: Cole and Youngs tackle plain speaking in hit podcast","content":"Dan Cole and Ben Youngs, two veteran players from the England rugby team, have launched a podcast titled \"For the Love of Rugby.\" This platform allows them to share insights and experiences from their long careers in rugby, offering a unique perspective that differs from traditional media interviews. According to them, rugby can be complicated, and their aim is to explain the game in simpler terms for fans.\n\nBoth players emphasize the importance of understanding the strategies and skills involved in rugby, which are often overlooked in mainstream discussions.

Youngs shares that he often advises young players to avoid reading press coverage, as it can be distracting.\n\nTheir podcast aims to foster a deeper understanding of the sport, making it more accessible. As they navigate this new venture alongside their ongoing rugby careers, Cole and Youngs are keen to provide fans with a genuine glimpse into the world of professional rugby."},{"title":"Even Prince William doesn’t attend church – it’s time for a new Reformation | Simon Jenkins","content":"In the article \"Even Prince William doesn’t attend church – it’s time for a new Reformation\" by Simon Jenkins, the author argues that the Church of England (C of E) is increasingly irrelevant in modern Britain, which has become a secular nation. With only 1.7% of the population actively worshipping, Jenkins highlights ongoing turmoil in the C of E regarding safeguarding issues and internal governance, which reflects a shift from being a state institution to just another religious sect.\n\nJenkins points to declining attendance and belief in God among the British populace, alongside the presence of more practicing Muslims than Anglicans. He critiques the church's cumbersome hierarchy and bureaucracy, noting the significant closure of churches and the challenge of maintaining heritage buildings with dwindling congregations. The local church, while historically significant, now struggles for relevance as community hubs.\n\nTo preserve these local churches, Jenkins suggests transferring them to community management, adapting their use for various local activities like libraries or community centers, and ultimately calls for the disestablishment of the C of E at a national level while re-establishing its role at a local level. He argues that Britain can function without an official church, advocating for a repurposing of these buildings to serve the community better."},{"title":"Charlotte Edwards: ‘I want to get English cricket back to where I know it can be’","content":"Charlotte Edwards, the former England women's cricket captain, expressed her desire to help restore English cricket to its former glory following the team's disappointing performance in the recent Ashes series against Australia.

Throughout his career, particularly during his time at Barcelona, he was often labeled as a lazy or undisciplined player, a stereotype that overshadowed his immense talent. \n\nIn recent months, Dembélé has significantly turned his performance around, currently scoring 18 goals in 10 games, including back-to-back hat-tricks, and is now regarded as a potential candidate for the Ballon d'Or. His positioning as a false 9 under coach Luis Enrique has allowed him to shine, showcasing his dribbling and finishing skills in a more prominent role within the team.\n\nThe article highlights how Dembélé has been unfairly shaped by media narratives and public perception, particularly during his younger years when he was depicted as an undisciplined youth enjoying a reclusive lifestyle. This public image contrasts sharply with his recent performances and behavior, which have received praise.\n\nThe piece suggests that this new phase in Dembélé’s career marks a redemption arc, allowing the player to finally express his capabilities without the burden of past stereotypes.

A new exhibition at the National Gallery, \"Siena: The Rise of Painting, 1300-1350,\" highlights Siena's significant contribution to European art, showcasing its unique Sienese School.\n\nHistorically, Siena was a powerful city-state thanks to its strategic location along trade routes. It experienced cultural and economic prosperity during the 13th and 14th centuries but suffered a major decline due to the Black Death in 1348, which decimated its population and hindered its artistic development.

Unlike typical depictions of widows in romantic comedies who remain passive in their grief, Bridget engages with her desires openly, even dating a younger man. The film highlights societal biases, showing how men are often seen as eligible after loss while women are viewed as grieving. This portrayal resonates deeply with widows, reflecting their messy realities and challenges in rebuilding their lives. While the film carries some traditional elements of the widow's journey, it overall presents a refreshing narrative of a woman embracing life and joy amidst grief, challenging conventional expectations of mourning."},{"title":"Starmer will go in ‘bin of history’ if he fails to raise defence budget, says ex-army chief","content":"Gen Lord Richard Dannatt, a former head of the British Army, warned that if Labour leader Keir Starmer does not raise the defence budget, he risks being forgotten in history. Dannatt stressed that a strategic defence review would be ineffective unless the defence budget increases to 3 or 3.5% of GDP, rather than the current proposal of 2.5%. He raised concerns that prioritizing health and education over defence could compromise national security. Starmer's suggestion for potential UK troop deployments to Ukraine as peacekeepers was also criticized, given the current limitations of the British military. Meanwhile, the UK government faces pressures to bolster defence spending to support NATO commitments amid global security concerns."},{"title":"WWF helping facilitate trade in polar bear fur, investigation reveals","content":"The WWF has been revealed to be facilitating the trade in polar bear fur while simultaneously using images of polar bears for fundraising. This comes amid concerns over the decline of polar bear populations due to climate change and habitat loss. \n\nCanada remains the only country allowing commercial hunting of polar bears, with around 300-400 skins exported annually, primarily to China. Although the WWF advocates for sustainable use of species, including polar bears, critics argue this approach is counterproductive and could lead to greater declines in populations. \n\nWWF has lobbied against full protection for polar bears at international meetings, asserting that the trade does not significantly threaten the species. However, this position is contested by many wildlife protection organizations, reflecting broader divisions on the issue.\n\nIndigenous voices, like that of Iñupiat guide Robert Thompson, highlight alternative income sources from eco-tourism rather than hunting. Internal critics within WWF have expressed concern that the organization's support for such trades may be at odds with its conservation goals, sparking shock within the conservation community."},{"title":"Blind date: ‘I really enjoyed chatting to her – even when she critiqued my dating app profile!’","content":"Matthew, a 24-year-old tax consultant, went on a blind date with 25-year-old advertising executive Izzy.

After initially thriving through strategic acquisitions and benefiting from a robust chemicals market, the company’s fortunes have reversed due to rising costs and declining refinery earnings post-COVID and after the energy crisis following the Ukraine invasion. \n\nIneos has seen a significant drop in profits, with reports indicating a profit decline from €2.28 billion in 2022 to just €407.8 million in 2023. Additionally, subsidiary losses have raised alarms about the company’s financial health, especially with a looming debt of nearly €12 billion. This situation echoes past financial crises where Ineos had to renegotiate debt repayment terms to avoid insolvency.\n\nRatcliffe's foray into the automotive industry with Ineos Automotive has been costly, reportedly consuming €1.4 billion since 2018 and accumulating substantial debt, compounded by supply chain issues. Moreover, his ownership of Manchester United has led to drastic cost-cutting measures deemed necessary to stabilize the club's finances and restore its competitive status.\n\nThe overarching narrative suggests that while diversification has aimed to bolster Ratcliffe's empire, the struggles in both the chemical and automotive sectors—coupled with external economic pressures—indicate a potential miscalculation in this ambitious business strategy."},{"title":"How to turn an old bread crust into a delectable British pudding – recipe | Waste not","content":"**How to Turn an Old Bread Crust Into a Delectable British Pudding – Recipe**\n\nTreacle tart is a classic British dessert perfect for using stale bread.

At a conference in Munich, Vance criticized Germany's current government just before elections where the far-right AfD party is expected to perform strongly. His meeting with AfD leader Alice Weidel breaks a political taboo in Germany, indicating a willingness to engage with extremist factions.\n\nAnalysts suggest that while Vance's actions might not directly influence the German elections or prompt the ruling parties to ally with the AfD, they reflect a broader objective of the U.S. right under Trump to support populist movements across Europe that align with their isolationist and anti-immigration stances. Leaders like Hungary's Viktor Orbán and Italy's Giorgia Meloni are seen as allies in this mission.\n\nVance’s strategy indicates a dismissal of traditional diplomatic protocols, as he avoided meeting with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, implying a shift in priorities towards populism and voter sentiment over established alliances. This approach mirrors Trump's tendency to redefine global relationships based on electoral mandates rather than historical diplomatic ties.\n\nThe involvement of U.S. politicians in European far-right politics raises questions about potential policy implications and the nature of future U.S.-European relations, hinting at significant changes that could disrupt the political landscape."},{"title":"OpenAI rejects $97.4bn Musk bid and says company is not for sale","content":"OpenAI has rejected a $97.4 billion bid from a consortium led by Elon Musk, stating that the company is not for sale.

They have taken control of significant areas, including the Kazingu and Bagira zones, with ongoing gunfire reported as they move towards the city center. The city, home to about 1 million people, has seen many businesses close and civilians flee due to fear of escalating violence.\n\nIn the days leading up to this, the rebels seized control of the Kavumu airport and captured other strategic locations, including Kabamba and Katana along the N2 road. The M23 group's recent advances culminated after seizing Goma, the capital of North Kivu, in January. Concerns over the humanitarian situation have intensified, with a reported 350,000 people now displaced due to the conflict.\n\nThe conflict in eastern DRC has historical roots in ethnic tensions and involves various armed groups, with the M23 notably being supported by Rwanda, which claims to be targeting extremist groups. However, international reports suggest that Rwanda is exploiting mineral resources through these groups.\n\nThe situation has drawn international attention, with calls for de-escalation and support for the Congolese government, now represented by Prime Minister Judith Suminwa Tuluka at the African Union summit, while President Félix Tshisekedi is abroad seeking assistance. The fighting has resulted in significant civilian casualties, most recently highlighted by the murder of a popular Congolese singer, raising further concerns about the safety of civilians amid the unrest."},{"title":"Manchester United to brief staff on ‘media reports’ of redundancies","content":"Manchester United is set to hold a team briefing on February 24 to address \"media reports\" concerning potential redundancies, expected to involve up to 200 job cuts.

While the production aims to evoke Wollstonecraft's radical spirit through fast-paced scenes and a lively score, it suffers from a disjointed narrative and emotional monotony. Directed by Esther Richardson, the play features a blend of styles reminiscent of mid-20th-century theatre but often lacks tonal variety and character depth. The first half is critiqued for being overly intense without enough emotional range, while the second half brings more substance but still struggles with its revolutionary messaging. Overall, the production is described as a \"patchy ode\" that fails to fully engage with its subject matter. It will run at Hull Truck theatre until March 1 and then at Wilton’s Music Hall in London later in March."},{"title":"‘Thought crime’ and cancelled elections: how do JD Vance’s claims about Europe stand up?","content":"JD Vance, speaking at the Munich Security Conference, made several controversial claims regarding the state of rights and freedoms in Europe, particularly focusing on the UK, Scotland, Romania, and other nations. He described what he termed a “backslide away from conscience rights” in the UK, citing the case of Adam Smith-Conner, who was convicted for silently praying near an abortion clinic, implying that this indicates an erosion of basic liberties. However, the facts detail that Smith-Conner was convicted after refusing to leave the area despite warnings, and the law in question was designed to prevent harassment near clinics.\n\nIn Scotland, Vance claimed that citizens were warned that private prayer in their homes could violate new laws around abortion clinic safety zones. This was fact-checked and found to be incorrect, as the Scottish government clarified that private prayer at home does not break the law unless it causes alarm to others.\n\nRegarding Romania, Vance referenced comments about the annulment of an election, suggesting a shift in democratic standards. This was linked to a Romanian court's decision based on concerns over electoral integrity, rather than any EU interference in elections.\n\nVance also addressed the EU’s Digital Services Act, claiming it allowed for social media shutdowns during civil unrest. While the EU does have powers to restrict platforms in urgent situations, such actions must follow due process, contrary to Vance's portrayal.\n\nIn Sweden, claims related to the conviction of a Christian activist involved in Qur'an burning led to misunderstandings about free speech protections, with Vance suggesting Sweden's laws suppressed free expression more than intended.\n\nFinally, Vance's comments about a recent car attack in Munich attributed blame to asylum seekers and linked it to broader security issues in Europe, drawing a connection that lacks substantiated evidence.\n\nThese statements reveal a broader narrative streamlining the discourse around perceived threats to rights and freedoms in Europe, yet many claims fail to align with the actual legal contexts and circumstances as outlined in factual analyses."},{"title":"PDC warns fans after crowd disrupts Premier League Darts night in Glasgow","content":"The Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) has issued a warning to fans following a disruptive incident during a Premier League Darts night in Glasgow.

The discussion with US Vice President JD Vance, lasting about an hour, ended without concrete announcements regarding a critical minerals deal, aimed at garnering American support for Ukraine.\n\nZelenskyy expressed reassurance after the meeting, feeling he had managed to shape the Trump administration’s approach more collaboratively, especially following concerns about premature concessions made by Trump to Putin. He described Putin as a liar and stated that all topics would be on the table in any future discussions with him.\n\nBoth leaders acknowledged that more talks are needed to establish a common understanding. Vance, accompanied by other US officials, did not disclose specific details about the peace plan, indicating a desire to keep options open for negotiators.\n\nEuropean leaders were reportedly reassured by the US that Ukraine would be consulted in any future peace talks and that its sovereignty would be upheld. They expressed frustration over statements from US officials that suggested Ukraine might have to give up territory and wouldn’t join NATO, prompting calls for unity in support of Ukraine.\n\nZelenskyy's comments also indicated a need for Europe to strengthen military support for Ukraine. He warned of potential Russian troop buildups aimed at European attacks. His government seeks strong security guarantees and increased military aid from allies to ensure Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity."},{"title":"Premier League sponsorship rules declared void in win for Manchester City","content":"A recent tribunal ruling has declared the Premier League's sponsorship rules related to associated party transactions (APTs) as \"void and unenforceable.\" This decision is a significant victory for Manchester City in their ongoing battle with the league. The tribunal concluded that the three unlawful aspects of the APT rules, in place from December 2021 to November 2024, could not be separated from the entire set of rules, thus rendering the APT rules as a whole invalid.\n\nAs a consequence, this ruling raises uncertainties about the Premier League's regulatory framework, especially since the league had already postponed the introduction of new squad cost control measures. Meanwhile, the Premier League has drafted a new set of APT rules that are not directly impacted by the judgment, and the league believes these are valid. \n\nHowever, Manchester City has challenged these new rules, with further adjudication expected. Should these new rules also be found unenforceable, it could lead to a crisis of confidence in the league's governance during a crucial time, as there are 130 disciplinary charges pending against City and ongoing discussions about establishing an independent regulator for the league."},{"title":"WHO calls for cigarette-style cancer warnings on alcohol packaging","content":"The World Health Organization (WHO) has called for cigarette-style warning labels on alcohol packaging, stating that such labels would inform consumers about the increased cancer risks associated with alcohol consumption. The recommendation aims to tackle the widespread unawareness that alcohol causes at least seven types of cancer, including breast and bowel cancer. Cancer charities support this initiative, highlighting the need for clear health warnings to enhance public awareness.\n\nCurrently, some countries, such as Ireland, plan to implement these warnings, while others, like France and Lithuania, already label alcohol concerning pregnancy risks. The WHO emphasizes that empowering individuals with this information strengthens their ability to make informed decisions about alcohol consumption.\n\nHowever, the Portman Group, which represents UK alcohol producers, argues that the warning labels would be an excessive measure and could lead to unnecessary anxiety among consumers.

His remarks were a departure from expected discussions on the Ukraine war, focusing instead on the perceived failures of European democratic principles and the need to listen to populist voices.\n\nHis speech drew severe backlash from EU and German officials, who labeled his comparisons of Europe to authoritarian regimes as unacceptable. Vance’s comments found favor with Russian state media, highlighting the increasing rift between transatlantic allies regarding values and governance.\n\nThe vice-president further criticized the avoidance of dialogue with populist parties in Europe and claimed that censorship, often framed as combating misinformation, threatens democracy.

The slogan \"Altadena is not for sale\" has emerged as a rallying cry, emphasizing a collective desire among community members to rebuild without the influence of developers seeking to capitalize on the disaster.\n\nMany locals, including those who lost their homes, have received unsolicited offers from developers while still reeling from the destruction.

It calls for continued support for global vaccination initiatives, particularly the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (Gavi), amid funding cuts from the US and potential cuts from the UK.\n\nThe piece stresses that vaccination is not only cost-effective but also essential for preventing disease outbreaks exacerbated by climate change and conflicts.

This exchange is a part of a ceasefire agreement following escalating tensions. The hostages were abducted during a Hamas attack in October 2023. While this exchange raises hopes for the continuation of the truce, uncertainties persist, particularly due to statements from U.S. President Donald Trump regarding Gaza's territorial claims, which have complicated the situation.\n\nThe released hostages were described as being in frail condition, prompting concerns about the hostages' treatment. The ongoing negotiations also face potential delays and conflicts, with Trump advocating for strict demands on hostage releases. Meanwhile, there are plans for a Saudi summit aimed at discussing alternatives for Gaza's future amidst fears of resumed violence.\n\nShould the upcoming exchanges proceed as planned, the total number of Israelis freed would reach 19 in exchange for approximately 1,100 Palestinians, with additional hostages expected to be released in future phases tied to further negotiations. However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's commitment to these negotiations remains questionable, raising risks for the fragile ceasefire."},{"title":"‘Time is running out’: frailty of freed hostages raises pressure on Netanyahu","content":"Recent releases of hostages from Hamas captivity have highlighted their frailty, heightening pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to expedite the return of remaining captives. Or Levy, who recently regained his freedom, expressed his gratitude to supporters while mourning the loss of his wife during the militants' attack on October 7, 2023. \n\nLevy, along with two other freed hostages, appeared extremely weakened, sparking concerns that Hamas might be releasing the healthier individuals first. This has intensified anxiety among families of remaining hostages, who fear for their safety. Reports indicate that some hostages endured severe conditions, including inadequate food and water, abuse, and infections.\n\nThe appearances of these hostages have increased public pressure on Netanyahu, who faces calls to maintain the ceasefire with Hamas despite right-wing coalition members advocating for a return to military action. Polling suggests Netanyahu’s Likud party has suffered due to the condition of the released hostages, complicating his political situation as he seeks to balance coalition demands with public sentiment regarding the hostages' welfare.\n\nAs negotiations regarding future releases continue amid threats from both sides, the future of the ceasefire remains uncertain, with ongoing discussions about the terms of future hostage releases. The priority for Netanyahu appears to lie more with political survival than the immediate welfare of the hostages."},{"title":"Fans turn on Levy as Tottenham face new low in familiar cycle of failure","content":"Tottenham Hotspur fans are increasingly frustrated with chairman Daniel Levy, leading to protests before their match against Manchester United. The supporters criticize Levy for prioritizing profit over sporting success, particularly amid the team's struggles, such as being 14th in the league and eliminated from domestic cup competitions. While manager Ange Postecoglou has faced scrutiny, fans are primarily blaming Levy for inadequate squad investments and inadequate responses to injuries during a crucial time. Protests are set to take place as anger mounts over the club's current performance and ownership dynamics. Despite financial success, supporters feel the club lacks ambition, exacerbated by Levy's significant salary amidst a low wages-to-revenue ratio. Rumors of potential ownership changes add to the unrest, as the future direction of the club remains uncertain. Overall, there is a pervasive sentiment that Spurs are in a cycle of failure under Levy's leadership."},{"title":"The Guide #178: How AI took over the commercial break","content":"The Guide #178 discusses the growing trend of artificial intelligence (AI) advertising, particularly highlighted during the Super Bowl. Traditionally, ads are often overlooked, but the recent emphasis on AI in commercials suggests companies are attempting to reshape public perception of AI as beneficial and friendly, rather than ominous.\n\nThe article notes how ads for AI products have featured celebrities like Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson, who promote AI as something that will help in mundane tasks rather than cause disruption. However, this presents a contradiction since many in the entertainment industry, including actors, are actively voicing concerns about AI's impact on their livelihoods.\n\nDespite the cheerful commercial narratives, there remains a palpable unease about AI among the public, with surveys indicating that many believe AI will do more harm than good. The article critiques the ad campaigns as attempts at reputation management rather than genuine excitement for technological advancement, leading to a potential backlash against overly simplified portrayals of AI's implications.\n\nIn summary, AI has made a significant appearance in advertising, but the reality of its societal impact complicates the narrative presented by these ads."},{"title":"Chloe Kelly finds her smile with second Arsenal career ready to launch","content":"Chloe Kelly is excited to restart her career at Arsenal after a challenging period at Manchester City.

Thomas’s work features monumental portraits of black women adorned with rhinestones, emphasizing their individuality and agency, contrasting their often marginal depictions in art history. Her pieces draw on joy and sorrow, using elements like glitter and sound to engage viewers and provoke reflection.\n\nLinder, known for her photocollages, presents a more surgical approach that critiques feminine imagery and societal norms through striking visual juxtapositions, blending elements of punk and feminism.

Trump suggested that the U.S. should control Gaza, presenting it as a development project aimed at transforming the area into a prime location. This statement has drawn widespread condemnation, including from over 350 rabbis and industry members. \n\nAbraham described Trump’s remarks as “irresponsible” and “immoral,” while Adra labeled them as \"insane\" and indicative of a power dynamic where Trump feels he faces no repercussions. They emphasized the legality issues surrounding the displacement of Palestinians and the transfer of Israeli populations into occupied territories.\n\nDespite its acclaim, including an award at the Berlin Film Festival, \"No Other Land\" struggled to find distribution in the U.S. due, as Abraham suggests, to political reasons. The film addresses the displacement of Palestinians in the West Bank, specifically in Masafer Yatta, and is now being independently screened in nearly 100 theaters. \n\nOverall, the film-makers express their commitment to raise awareness about the plight of Palestinians, especially in light of the ongoing conflict and humanitarian crisis."},{"title":"‘Crystal Methodist’ fails to show for Manchester sentencing hearing","content":"A judge issued an arrest warrant for Paul Flowers, the former Methodist minister and ex-chairman of the Co-operative Bank, after he failed to attend a sentencing hearing for fraud in Manchester.

He became known as the \"Crystal Methodist\" after being caught on video buying illegal drugs in 2013. The judge noted that Flowers had disengaged from his legal team and cited mental health issues, but emphasized that a custodial sentence was likely due to the serious nature of the offenses involving a vulnerable victim.

He expressed pride not only in his achievement but in the mindset change it represents.\n\nHis journey to this certification began when he joined ESA's reserve astronaut corps in November 2022, with the goal of assessing whether a lower limb amputee could participate in space missions. By the end of 2024, the feasibility study confirmed there were no barriers to his participation, leading to his certification as an astronaut capable of flying to the ISS.\n\nMcFall emphasized the importance of acknowledging his capabilities rather than questioning them, countering the label \"parastronaut,\" which he feels creates an unnecessary distinction. His certification was positively received by ESA's international partners, reflecting a progressive stance on diversity and inclusion in space exploration.

The restaurant, located in east London, has quickly gained popularity, receiving overwhelming demand since its opening, coinciding with Haworth’s television success.\n\nPlates features a tasting menu devoid of traditional dairy and meat products, innovatively replacing them with plant-based alternatives. Notable dishes include a slow-cooked leek treatment paired with frozen verjus and a lasagna made from mung and urad beans, challenging diners' perceptions of what vegetarian food can be. The restaurant emphasizes experience over imitation, avoiding the labels often associated with plant diets.\n\nThe ambiance of Plates is designed to be both casual and refined, with a semi-open kitchen and thoughtfully arranged décor.

Burns recounted witnessing multiple medical errors and having to request antibiotics eight times before they were administered, significantly delaying critical treatment. She expressed her heartbreak and the aftermath of this loss, which has left her unable to work at the hospital where she had dedicated over 20 years.\n\nThe inquest revealed that William, a 22-year-old student, was not given necessary antibiotics until 1:25 AM despite his dire condition. Dr. Burns highlighted that during his treatment, medical staff failed to monitor him properly and there were significant delays in transferring him to intensive care. Dr. Ron Daniels, an intensive care consultant, testified that timely intervention could have potentially saved William's life, estimating that many young adults in similar conditions would survive with prompt treatment.\n\nThe inquest continues as questions arise about the reliability of the care William received and whether earlier actions could have altered the tragic outcome."},{"title":"Rollback on diversity policies ‘risks undoing decades of progress’, says Co-op","content":"The CEO of the Co-op group has expressed concerns that a rollback on diversity initiatives in the UK could reverse decades of progress.

Shirine Khoury-Haq emphasized that rolling back DEI is not just a business choice, but has significant real-world implications, fostering inequality and eroding trust.\n\nIn the UK, some firms, like BT, have reportedly scaled back their DEI initiatives, prompting worry among industry leaders. Khoury-Haq lamented the rapid withdrawal from diversity efforts, questioning if those companies were ever truly committed. The UK equalities minister affirmed that the government remains dedicated to addressing racial inequality and fostering diversity.\n\nRecent research indicates a strong business case for gender and ethnic diversity in corporate leadership.

The investigation revealed that D'Amario had a pattern of bullying behavior and had likely violated employment law. Despite the findings, D’Amario continues to lead the company and receives a considerable salary, while the employee who raised the allegations has left the organization.\n\nThe controversy gained traction after Cora Corré, Vivienne Westwood's granddaughter, resigned from the company, accusing D’Amario of misusing designs and contesting trademarks. The internal investigation included testimonies from staff who reported D’Amario's use of disparaging nicknames based on sexuality and derogatory comments about the company's LGBTQ+ representation.

The narrative centers on a troubled Berlin family whose lives are uplifted by a Syrian cleaner named Farrah, who embodies a magical, transformative presence, offering unconventional methods to tackle their depression.\n\nThe film runs for a lengthy two hours and 40 minutes, balancing moments of comedy and social commentary. The family, comprising Tim, a modern father played by Lars Eidinger, and his wife Milena, portrayed by Nicolette Krebitz, grapples with their privileged lifestyle as they navigate personal issues involving their teenage children, Frieda and Jon. The arrival of Farrah, after a comically dark incident with their previous cleaner, introduces a mystical element meant to catalyze emotional healing within the family.\n\nDespite its energetic premise and notable performances, the film is critiqued for its lack of coherent direction and an overreliance on pop culture references, notably Queen's \"Bohemian Rhapsody,\" which serves as a somewhat desperate attempt to inject life into the narrative. While \"Das Licht\" tackles significant themes, including the complexities of identity and the societal impact of migration, it ultimately struggles to deliver a cohesive message, leaving a sense of incompleteness in its exploration of these issues. The film screens at the Berlin film festival, capturing a moment of peculiar charm yet profound disarray in contemporary cinema."},{"title":"What is the DEI rollback and where will it spread next?","content":"The DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion) rollback refers to a recent trend in which many U.S. corporations are reversing or overhauling their diversity and inclusion policies. This movement gained momentum after Donald Trump signed executive orders revoking DEI programs in the federal government, triggering similar actions in the private sector, particularly among major finance and tech companies like Goldman Sachs, Accenture, and Google. These firms have begun eliminating diversity hiring goals, career development programs for specific demographic groups, and even notable diversity observances.\n\nThe rollback is linked to a longstanding movement by rightwing activists who criticize DEI initiatives as \"reverse discrimination,” intensified by a 2023 Supreme Court ruling that ended affirmative action in college admissions. This alignment with rightwing agendas has led companies such as Walmart, McDonald’s, Ford, Amazon, and Meta to also modify their DEI initiatives.\n\nWhile the trend in the U.S. is evident, its impact on the UK is still evolving. Some U.S. companies operating in the UK have declared their commitment to maintain diversity initiatives, despite shifts in the U.S. landscape. Employment lawyers express concern that U.S. changes might influence practices in the UK, potentially leading to legal complications.\n\nTrade unions in the UK are apprehensive about multinational firms adopting Americanized rightwing policies and are urging for the continued need for robust diversity initiatives to address workplace inequalities. Despite the rollback, some UK firms remain committed to diversity, as they recognize the competitive advantage it brings in attracting younger talent.\n\nIn conclusion, the DEI rollback, originating from political shifts in the U.S., could spread further, impacting not just companies in the U.S. but potentially influencing their operations in the UK and beyond, despite ongoing resistance from some corporate leaders and labor unions."},{"title":"Ravneet Gill’s recipe for tapioca pudding with roast rhubarb | The sweet spot","content":"Ravneet Gill’s recipe for tapioca pudding with roast rhubarb offers a delightful twist on the traditional dessert.

An impact report on the forthcoming immigration law reveals that around 60,000 applicants could be denied permission to remain in France due to these stringent tests. The law, aimed at promoting foreign integration, raises the required proficiency level to that of an 11-15-year-old French student.\n\nInvestigation shows that five out of ten French nationals, including a highly educated literature student, failed the written portion of the tests. Educators argue that the tests set an unrealistic standard for many foreign nationals, and previous obligations for residency applicants are being tightened.\n\nThe law aligns with policies in neighboring countries and is seen as a move to encourage responsibility and integration among foreign residents. Critics, however, note that many individuals, regardless of their daily use of French, may still be unable to pass the exams due to their complexity.\n\nThe new legislation, passed in January 2024, is one of several measures reflected in a political shift to more stringent immigration controls under President Emmanuel Macron's government. Exemptions are expected for retirees and certain visitor categories, but the final implementation date remains undecided."},{"title":"Revealed: fugitive Dutch drug lord has been in Sierra Leone for at least two years","content":"Johannes Leijdekkers, a fugitive Dutch drug lord with a lengthy criminal history, has been living in Sierra Leone for at least two years, engaging in social activities like attending nightclubs and parties. He was sentenced in absentia to significant prison time in the Netherlands for serious offenses, including large-scale cocaine trafficking and murder. Recently, footage surfaced of him attending a church service with the Sierra Leone presidential family, suggesting he may have high-level protection.\n\nSources indicate that Leijdekkers has been in Sierra Leone since at least December 2022, with evidence linking him to various social events, including a New Year's Eve party and a gathering hosted by a prominent local couple. He is reportedly in a relationship with Agnes Bio, the daughter of Sierra Leone's president. Despite his visible presence in the country, authorities claim they were unaware of his identity and alleged criminal background until more recent reports came to light.\n\nSierra Leonean authorities say they are investigating the situation, but there are discrepancies regarding his identity, as local officials have described him using a different name. Meanwhile, the Dutch government is pursuing an extradition request for Leijdekkers, although it remains uncertain whether he is still in Sierra Leone."},{"title":"Emma Raducanu takes new wildcard in Dubai in bid to stop losing run","content":"Emma Raducanu has received a wildcard entry into the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships as she aims to end a streak of four consecutive match losses.

Recent analyses reveal that at the last conference of the ICAO's Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection (CAEP), industry delegates outnumbered representatives from environmental groups by a margin of ten to one. The ICAO and related events have been sponsored by major fossil fuel companies, leading critics to claim that the organization has been \"captured\" by these interests, thereby hindering effective action against aviation emissions.\n\nThe ICAO has faced criticism for its lack of transparency, as meeting documents are often not publicly accessible, and attendance at CAEP events is restricted. Independent experts argue that the ICAO's plans for reducing emissions are \"critically insufficient,\" and the anticipated growth in passenger numbers will likely exacerbate climate issues if not properly managed.\n\nCalls for increased transparency and accountability within the ICAO have been made, including from members of CAEP itself. The article highlights the risks of allowing industry representation to dominate discussions on climate actions, ultimately serving the interests of aviation companies over scientific-backed solutions."},{"title":"Patrick Barclay, talented and respected football journalist, dies aged 77","content":"Patrick Barclay, the respected football journalist, has passed away at the age of 77.

It suggests that late winter is an ideal time for pruning and taking hardwood cuttings. \n\nTo propagate, one should use a clean pair of secateurs to cut healthy growth from the previous year into 15-30cm lengths, ensuring at least one pair of buds is present for new root development. The top cut should be made at an angle above a bud. \n\nFor planting, the article recommends digging a trench in well-draining soil, adding sand for drainage, and positioning the cuttings so that one-third remains above ground. Due to potential waterlogging in heavy clay soils, using containers with multipurpose compost mixed with sand is an alternative method. \n\nWatering is crucial, and cuttings should be protected from frost and garden pests. This propagation method is noted for its reliability even without specialized environments, making it accessible for most gardeners."},{"title":"‘White supremacists in suits and ties’: the rightwing Afrikaner group in Trump’s ear","content":"The article discusses the influence of the Afrikaner group AfriForum on Donald Trump's policies, specifically regarding South Africa's white minority. Trump recently offered political asylum to white South Africans, allegedly following a campaign by AfriForum that has pushed the narrative of “white genocide” and claimed that the South African government is targeting white farmers under new land reform laws. The article states that this is a misrepresentation of reality, as the new law aims at addressing historical inequalities from apartheid, and the majority of violence against farmers is not politically motivated.\n\nAfriForum has been active in lobbying the Trump administration, promoting false claims about white persecution while also assisting Elon Musk—who has expressed similar views—in trying to bypass South African affirmative action laws for his business interests. Musk's involvement partly stems from his upbringing in apartheid South Africa, which shapes his perspectives on race in the country. \n\nThe organization and its representatives have made numerous trips to the US to gain political support, framing their views on government policies as a defense of the Afrikaner minority against state-sponsored discrimination. The wider involvement of figures like Musk and connections with other tech billionaires raised in South Africa add to the narrative's prominence in American politics.\n\nOverall, the article highlights the convergence of right-wing rhetoric, misinformation about race relations in South Africa, and political lobbying by groups like AfriForum, which underscores a broader trend of aligning with nationalist and extremist views within US politics."},{"title":"‘No one wants to pay $25 for breakfast’: US restaurants are cracking under inflation","content":"US restaurants, particularly breakfast spots, are facing severe economic pressures due to soaring ingredient prices fueled by inflation. For instance, egg prices have doubled, impacting dishes that heavily rely on them, such as omelets and pancakes. Costs for other staples like coffee and orange juice have also surged, with coffee at a 47-year high linked to climate effects in producing countries.\n\nRestaurateurs are struggling to maintain affordable prices for customers already feeling the pinch from inflation, with experts noting a median price increase of 19% for popular breakfast items over the past year. Restaurant owners, like Stephen Slaughter of Green Eggs Cafe, are reluctant to raise prices significantly, fearing it will alienate loyal customers, especially since many dishes can no longer be produced as cost-effectively as before.\n\nWhile some eateries are innovating with different menu items to mitigate costs, the reliance on traditional breakfast foods and the accompanying price increases present a challenge. The competitive nature of the breakfast market, where restaurants traditionally thrive on high-volume sales of inexpensive dishes, is now being jeopardized.\n\nOverall, rising operational costs, coupled with consumer price sensitivity, raise concerns about the sustainability of profit margins in the breakfast restaurant sector. Many owners are in a difficult position—forced to adapt while trying to preserve their customer base amidst rapidly fluctuating prices."},{"title":"A ‘gorgeous medieval’ town in Tuscany and other readers’ tips across Italy","content":"Readers shared various travel tips highlighting beautiful locations across Italy. \n\n1. **Barga, Tuscany**: A picturesque medieval town in northern Tuscany, notable for its connection to Scotland and its local delicacies, especially chestnut flour pasta with porcini mushrooms.\n\n2. **Catania, Sicily**: An underrated vibrant city known for its culinary scene, particularly arancini and cannoli, and proximity to Mount Etna and charming coastal towns like Taormina.\n\n3. **Locorotondo, Puglia**: Famous for its white-washed trulli houses and stunning views, this circular town offers an authentic Southern Italian experience with beautiful scenery and local cafes.\n\n4. **Valle di Cadore, Dolomites**: A serene area ideal for hiking with breathtaking views and charming villages, away from crowds.

Now it’s time to defend ourselves | Jodie Ginsberg","content":"In her article, Jodie Ginsberg emphasizes the need for a unified defense of the press against political threats, particularly in light of Donald Trump's previous characterization of the media as \"enemies of the people.\" She draws parallels to the Nixon administration's attempts to suppress the publication of the Pentagon Papers and highlights the historical bravery of media leaders like Katharine Graham of the Washington Post, who defied a court order to protect First Amendment rights.\n\nGinsberg expresses concern over recent capitulations by media outlets, such as ABC News settling a defamation lawsuit with Trump and CBS considering settling over an edited interview. These actions, she argues, signal an alarming trend of media outlets yielding to political pressure, which could further undermine the press's independence. \n\nThe article also addresses the challenges faced by smaller, nonprofit news organizations that are vulnerable to legal harassment, often lacking the resources to defend against costly lawsuits. Ginsberg warns that such legal intimidation can impact public perception of the media and contribute to declining trust.\n\nUltimately, she calls for all media institutions to stand firmly for their right to report the news without fear, asserting that overcoming such challenges is essential for preserving freedom of expression and informing the public."},{"title":"Tilda Swinton decries ‘internationally enabled mass murder’ at Berlin film festival","content":"Tilda Swinton made headlines during her speech at the Berlin Film Festival after receiving a Golden Bear for lifetime achievement.

After spending nearly two years in administration, the club was acquired by a consortium led by former Formula One team owner Eddie Jordan. However, the RFU is unlikely to grant the necessary license for the move, as it requires board approval, especially since no English club has previously been allowed to exit the league system in such a manner.\n\nThe team’s situation is complicated by past financial issues, resulting in significant funding from the RFU, which makes them hesitant to permit the transition to a competing league. The RFU also has concerns regarding the implications of the junior teams operating under the English system while the senior team competes in the URC. Given these challenges, the new ownership might have to redirect their focus towards re-entering the Championship rather than joining the URC. \n\nThe RFU and Premiership Rugby have not commented publicly on the matter, but it’s clear that the path forward for London Irish is fraught with regulatory hurdles."},{"title":"Our 2024 NFL predictions revisited: the Chiefs weren’t inevitable after all","content":"The 2024 NFL predictions revisited reveal that the Kansas City Chiefs, previously considered favorites for the Super Bowl, were not as dominant as anticipated. While some predictions about teams and players were accurate, many turned out to be inaccurate. \n\nBefore the season, the writers expected strong performances from teams like the Jets, Colts, and Bears, but these teams struggled significantly. The Bills, initially doubted, performed well and reached the AFC Championship game. Patrick Mahomes was a predicted MVP, but Josh Allen won the award instead, with Mahomes' connection to key players faltering over the season. \n\nIn terms of rookies, expectations for Caleb Williams fell flat due to poor coaching and a high sack count, while Jayden Daniels emerged as a standout. The AFC divisions saw some surprises, with the Texans winning the South and the Rams claiming the West after the 49ers’ decline. \n\nUltimately, the Eagles shocked predictions by decisively defeating the Chiefs in the Super Bowl, highlighting that team completeness trumps individual star power and that the idea of inevitability in the NFL is misleading."},{"title":"That new land use policy that the Tories call ‘national suicide’? It’s urgent, essential – and their idea | Henry Dimbleby","content":"In his article, Henry Dimbleby addresses the recent backlash against a new land use policy introduced by the Tories, which some critics, like shadow farming minister Robbie Moore, labeled \"national suicide.\" Dimbleby, the original author of the proposal as part of the 2021 National Food Strategy, argues that this framework aims to improve land use planning by centralizing essential data about soil health, agricultural productivity, and environmental concerns in a user-friendly format.\n\nHe states that the framework is designed to help align government policies across departments and promote efficient land use amid the pressing challenges of climate change and biodiversity loss. Contrary to the accusations of imposing strict regulations, Dimbleby insists that the policy will provide better information and incentives for landowners to make sustainable decisions without coercion.\n\nDimbleby emphasizes the urgency of adopting this framework, likening the current situation to the post-World War II need for food security. He advocates for pragmatic, collaborative approaches rather than politicization, stating that long-term success hinges on evidence-based policies and cross-party support to secure a sustainable future."},{"title":"Experience: I’m the karaoke world champion","content":"Elizabeth Moya, a karaoke world champion from Chile, shares her journey in a reflective piece.
