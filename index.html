Following the layoffs, officials recognized the need to reinstate some of these workers but encountered difficulties in contacting them due to missing information. The NNSA operates several key laboratories and sites involved in nuclear weapon safety and modernization, and struggles to maintain its workforce amid significant budget allocations and strategic nuclear policies. Trump's comments on nuclear weapon spending and denuclearization have added to the context surrounding these workforce changes."},{"title":"Jannik Sinner’s doping settlement means nobody loses from ban but try telling Halep that | Simon Cambers","content":"Jannik Sinner's recent doping settlement has resulted in a three-month ban, which many see as beneficial for him, allowing him to recharge after winning the Australian Open. Sinner's acceptance of a shorter ban, rather than risking a lengthy suspension through appeal, allows him to return just in time for the French Open, reinforcing his status as the top player. The settlement underscores the principle that athletes are responsible for what enters their bodies, a vital aspect of the anti-doping program. \n\nAlthough the outcome appears favorable for Sinner, it has sparked discontent among other players like Simona Halep and Tara Moore, who faced harsher penalties under similar contamination circumstances. Sinner's situation was perceived as more lenient due to his resources and public image, leaving a lingering sense of inequality in doping-related cases. As the tennis world adjusts to these developments, Sinner may return rejuvenated, potentially maintaining his competitive edge in upcoming tournaments."},{"title":"What is the big idea? Levy’s second-class Tottenham Women mired in mediocrity | Jonathan Liew","content":"The article by Jonathan Liew critiques Tottenham Hotspur Women, highlighting the team's stagnation and mediocrity under the leadership of Daniel Levy. Despite aspirations for growth, the women's team remains stuck in mid-table, lacking a clear strategy or competitive edge against top opponents. The team's playing style has not effectively utilized its talents, leading to frequent defeats against stronger clubs.\n\nLiew points out inconsistencies in recruitment approaches, suggesting the club has tried to play at a high level with inadequate resources. The lack of investment and commitment to a long-term vision has resulted in a deeper gap between Spurs and elite teams. While there are promising initiatives and talent within the club, such as coach Robert Vilahamn and a new training center, the overarching strategy seems reactive rather than proactive, leaving Tottenham Women as a second-class operation within the club's structure.\n\nOverall, the piece questions Levy's ambitions for the women's team, indicating a tendency to maintain the status quo rather than strive for genuine progress."},{"title":"Big No 9s are back: high-risk playing out from the back is at the tactical crossroads | Jonathan Wilson","content":"In Jonathan Wilson's article, he discusses the evolving tactics in football, particularly the increasing risk associated with playing out from the back. He observes that while possession-based football, inspired by Pep Guardiola, has dominated recent years, it’s facing challenges as opponents become more adept at pressing. The article suggests that teams may need to reconsider their approaches, particularly those promoted to the Premier League, as exemplified by Burnley and Southampton’s struggles.\n\nWilson argues that the initial dominance of passing from the back is being countered by effective pressing strategies. Teams may need to devise exit strategies when pressed, possibly by sending long balls into channels. The potential resurgence of \"big No 9s\" as teams look for greater effectiveness in attack could signal a shift in tactical philosophy, indicating that high-risk buildup play is at a tactical crossroads."},{"title":"Poppy Cleall drives Saracens to win over Exeter to close in on home semi-final","content":"Poppy Cleall played a key role in driving Saracens to a 21-12 victory over Exeter Chiefs in the Premiership Women’s Rugby match. Despite the challenging conditions at StoneX Stadium, Saracens showcased their defensive strength and efficient play to secure the win. \n\nExeter started strong with an early try but Saracens quickly responded with three first-half tries, including one from Cleall, leading 21-7 at halftime. Exeter struggled to maintain possession and mount a comeback until they scored again in the second half. However, Saracens maintained control, with their solid defense and tactical discipline ultimately sealing their win.\n\nThis victory places Saracens second in the league and puts them in a favorable position to secure a home semi-final as they prepare for their last match against Sale Sharks. The team's effectiveness in contrast to Exeter’s inability to capitalize on their opportunities highlighted the disparity between the two sides, sending Exeter out of the semi-final race."},{"title":"US Forest Service and National Park Service to fire thousands of workers","content":"The US Forest Service is set to terminate about 3,400 recent hires, while the National Park Service will let go of approximately 1,000 workers as part of President Donald Trump's initiative to reduce federal spending and bureaucracy. These cuts affect employees in their initial probationary period, impacting national sites like Yellowstone and the Appalachian trail. The reductions represent roughly 10% of the Forest Service workforce and 5% of the National Park Service staff but exclude essential personnel such as firefighters. Critics, including the National Parks Conservation Association, have expressed concerns that these staffing cuts will result in poorer visitor experiences, with potential issues like unclean facilities and fewer rangers available for guidance. Furthermore, a recent funding freeze has hindered vital wildfire prevention programs, complicating the situation regarding staffing and resources for fire management as the summer season approaches."},{"title":"Our inhumane jails are promoting a vicious cycle that is criminal in itself  | Martha Gill","content":"Martha Gill's article addresses the dire state of British prisons and their role in perpetuating a cycle of crime. The jails are described as inhumane, with reports highlighting severe neglect and unsafe conditions, such as broken facilities, infestations, and chronic shortages of basic services. \n\nThe prison population has risen dramatically, leading to overcrowding. Stiffer sentences and increased remand numbers mean that individuals are crammed into cells, resulting in long periods of isolation. This isolation breeds boredom, which can lead to self-harm and violence, further complicating the environment for both inmates and staff. The staff shortage has reached critical levels, with experienced officers leaving, exacerbating the cycle of violence and decreased safety.\n\nGill argues that the conditions in prisons not only fail to rehabilitate inmates but actively hinder their reintegration into society, increasing the likelihood of reoffending. To address these issues, she suggests considering the reduction of prison sentences, particularly for non-violent crimes, and highlights the importance of public perception on crime and sentencing. She believes that presenting detailed statistics and success stories from other countries could shift public opinion toward supporting rehabilitative measures over punitive ones. \n\nOverall, Gill calls for a comprehensive reassessment of the penal system to break the cycle of crime and promote better outcomes for society."},{"title":"Cat person or dog person? It’s which animal we loathe that matters in the end | Andrew Anthony","content":"In Andrew Anthony's article, he explores the divisive nature of pet preferences, particularly focusing on the rivalry between cat and dog lovers. The resignation of a parish councillor over a bizarre incident involving a cat and a firework further illustrates how intense these feelings can become. The piece discusses the statistics surrounding the impact of both cats and dogs on wildlife, highlighting that while cats are responsible for a significant number of bird deaths, dogs also have their own negative impacts.\n\nAnthony delves into the philosophical underpinnings of pet preferences, suggesting that it is not solely about which animal one loves but also about whom one dislikes. He argues that our feelings towards pets reveal deeper emotional connections and latent antipathies. While dogs are often lauded for their loyalty and companionship, cats are critiqued for their independence and aloofness.\n\nThe article concludes with a humorous take on personal preference, siding with dogs while acknowledging the complexities of pet ownership, emphasizing that although cats may not be deserving of harm, they embody a certain enigmatic charm that divides opinion. Ultimately, the piece reflects on how these preferences touch on broader themes of loyalty, independence, and the nature of affection in human-animal relationships."},{"title":"Why can’t we remember our lives as babies or toddlers?","content":"People generally do not remember events from their earliest years due to a phenomenon known as \"infantile amnesia,\" a term coined by Sigmund Freud in 1905. This amnesia usually covers memories from before the age of two or three. Researchers have long been puzzled as to why we cannot recall these early experiences, despite them shaping our later lives.\n\nRecent studies indicate that while young brains may not be fully developed to form lasting memories, toddlers as young as two can remember events in detail. However, the hippocampus, a critical brain region for memory formation, develops during early childhood, which may contribute to the inability to retrieve those memories later.\n\nCultural factors also play a significant role in memory recall. For instance, American and Chinese children tend to have their earliest memories emerge at different ages due to cultural differences in self-identity and narrative practices. For example, Māori children in New Zealand recall memories earlier than those from European backgrounds, partly due to oral traditions and the way parents engage in reminiscing.\n\nFinally, memories are not stored like discrete files; they are networks of neurons, subject to change each time they are recalled. While some early memories may be fictional constructions influenced by family narratives or photographs, true confabulation is rare. Ultimately, while significant experiences might be stored in the brain, our ability to consciously access them is limited. The adaptive function of forgetting these memories and how they might serve as foundational schemas for future memory remains an area of ongoing research."},{"title":"‘I knew those things couldn’t sit in a box’: Lowitja O’Donoghue’s niece sheds new light on her extraordinary life","content":"The article discusses the life and legacy of Lowitja O'Donoghue, a prominent Indigenous rights campaigner in Australia. Following her passing at the age of 91, her family, particularly her niece Deb Edwards, has been sorting through her belongings to prepare for an exhibition at the Bob Hawke Prime Ministerial Centre in Adelaide. This exhibition aims to showcase O'Donoghue's remarkable journey from being a stolen child to a pioneering nurse and influential advocate for Aboriginal rights.\n\nEdwards mentions that O'Donoghue's home served as a \"gallery\" reflecting her life's work and that the exhibition will highlight personal items and significant documents that tell her story. O'Donoghue was the first Aboriginal nurse at the Royal Adelaide Hospital, overcoming significant barriers related to her heritage. She played vital roles in historical initiatives such as the 1967 referendum, the passing of the Native Title Act, and the national apology to the stolen generations.\n\nThe exhibition, titled \"Lowitja – A Life of Leadership and Legacy,\" will take place from June 4 to July 25, 2025, and is expected to present a multifaceted view of O'Donoghue, illustrating both her public achievements and personal moments. Edwards reflects on O'Donoghue's dual nature of being deeply involved in her community while simultaneously engaging with significant global figures, including Nelson Mandela. The preparation of the exhibition serves as a tribute to O'Donoghue's life and a fulfillment of her wishes, as expressed by both her biographer and her niece."},{"title":"The moment I knew: I’d had lots of lovers during our open relationship – then I realised I could trust him with my life","content":"In a personal narrative, photographer William Yang reflects on his relationship with Scott, which began in the late 90s amidst a backdrop of their open long-distance arrangement. Initially drawn together by shared interests and an age difference of 30 years, their bond deepened over time, characterized by mutual respect and separate lives.\n\nA pivotal moment came in 2010, when William faced the sudden death of his brother. Amidst the chaos of arranging the funeral, Scott proved to be a steadfast companion, helping William navigate family tensions and administrative duties. This crisis revealed Scott's reliability and solidified William's trust in him, marking a significant turning point in their relationship.\n\nAs William aged, he reevaluated the qualities he valued in a partner, ultimately placing trust at the forefront. Despite their continued open relationship and living in different states, William granted Scott power of attorney, which he considered a greater commitment than marriage. This gesture encapsulated the depth of their connection, cementing Scott's role as someone William could depend on, reinforcing that true intimacy can exist within the framework of an open partnership."},{"title":"The Observer view: Change to UK citizenship rule is cruel and misjudged | Observer editorial","content":"The Observer editorial criticizes a recent change in UK citizenship rules that penalizes asylum seekers arriving illegally or through dangerous routes. This amendment to the \"good character\" guidelines effectively prevents refugees, often fleeing dire situations, from obtaining British citizenship. The change is deemed cruel and unjustified, contravening international agreements like the 1951 Refugee Convention. The editorial highlights that the government’s approach aims to present toughness on immigration, potentially backfiring and creating more social division while failing to address the complex realities of forced migration and the need for safe routes for asylum seekers. It calls for a holistic and humane strategy to manage asylum applications, emphasizing the importance of public support for refugee rights and the need for effective, compassionate policies."},{"title":"‘It can be really frightening’: knowing the common signs that a loved one is dying can help in their final days","content":"Understanding the signs that a loved one is nearing death can help families navigate a profoundly difficult experience. Dr. Kerrie Noonan, a clinical psychologist, highlights that many people today are distanced from death, often leading to shock when they witness the signs of impending death that they are unfamiliar with. Common changes in a dying person's body may include reduced appetite and drinking, weakness, altered consciousness, and irregular breathing patterns. \n\nExperts suggest that providing comfort, such as holding hands or speaking to the person, is vital, as hearing remains intact until the end. Ken Hillman, a professor at the University of New South Wales, points out that society often denies death, treating it as a medical failure, which can hinder open conversations about end-of-life care.\n\nCultural attitudes toward death vary, influencing how communities handle discussions about it and the associated rituals. Encouragingly, awareness of death literacy appears to be increasing in Australia, prompting more people to engage with the topic. In summary, while facing the end of life is challenging, understanding the signs of dying can lead to more meaningful experiences for both the individual and their loved ones."},{"title":"Keely Hodgkinson shows her Klassic formula can inspire new generation","content":"Keely Hodgkinson, the Olympic 800m gold medalist, recently held an event called the Keely Klassic at the Utilita Arena in Birmingham to inspire a new generation of athletics fans. Despite being sidelined by a hamstring injury, Hodgkinson successfully attracted a young and predominantly female audience, creating an energetic atmosphere reminiscent of concert vibes rather than traditional athletics meets. The event featured popular music between races, enhancing engagement among attendees.\n\nMany young fans expressed excitement about following Hodgkinson's career after her Olympic success, where she garnered significant viewership. The event included competitions among British athletes, with notable performances recorded, although the focus was on the lively environment. The keen participation from attendees, including a family who attended specifically to see Hodgkinson, highlighted the positive reception of the event, despite her absence on the track. \n\nHodgkinson expressed her commitment to fostering interest in the sport and hopes to return to competition soon, with aspirations for the upcoming world championships."},{"title":"‘We can’t change our leader again’: Tories despair at Badenoch’s poor PMQs performances","content":"Kemi Badenoch, the leader of the Conservative Party, is facing criticism for her performances during Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs). Many Tory MPs believe she needs to change her approach when challenging Labour leader Keir Starmer, as she has been accused of choosing irrelevant topics rather than addressing more important issues like the economy. Despite being in her role for only four months, there are calls for her to enhance her advisory team with experienced political strategists to improve her tactics.\n\nCritics point out that her recent exchanges focused on less impactful issues, which led to ineffective responses from Starmer. Supporters of Badenoch urge patience, asserting that significant leadership improvements take time. However, concerns remain that poor results in the upcoming local elections may lead to discussions about leadership change, a scenario that many Tory MPs want to avoid. Nonetheless, Badenoch's close allies defend her strategy, claiming she is effectively holding the government accountable amidst the challenges of opposition leadership."},{"title":"Rachel Reeves has three options to dodge an economic crisis and all are unthinkable","content":"Rachel Reeves, the first woman to serve as Chancellor, is facing significant challenges as the UK's economic situation deteriorates. With a projected growth rate cut from 1.5% to 0.75% and rising borrowing costs, her financial leeway of £9.9bn is likely to vanish, forcing her to make tough decisions. She has three unappealing options: raise taxes, cut spending, or break her fiscal rules, all of which could have damaging political consequences. Despite the need for action, Reeves has ruled out these options, leaving her in a precarious position. Economists suggest praying for economic growth, but this may not materialize in time to alleviate her fiscal constraints. \n\nOverall, Reeves is caught in a bind where any decision could lead to adverse reactions in financial markets, compounded by her previous commitments against austerity and additional tax burdens on working people."},{"title":"Two-year-old girl and her mother die from Munich car attack injuries","content":"A two-year-old girl and her mother have died from injuries sustained in a car-ramming attack in Munich. The attack, which occurred during a trade union demonstration, left 37 others injured. A 24-year-old Afghan man, suspected of driving the car deliberately, has been arrested and is believed to have had Islamist extremist motives. The suspect reportedly shouted \"Allahu Akbar\" to police after the incident. This tragic event happened shortly before the upcoming elections in Germany, where immigration is a significant topic of discussion."},{"title":"Revealed: Google facilitated Russia and China’s censorship requests","content":"An investigation by the Observer has revealed that Google has been cooperating with autocratic governments, including Russia and China, to facilitate censorship requests. Since 2011, Google has engaged with about 150 countries seeking to remove unfavorable content, including interactions with dictatorships and regimes accused of human rights abuses. Requests have escalated, with over 5.6 million items named for removal globally after government requests.\n\nIn Russia, Google has removed content like YouTube videos criticizing the government and blocked access to political content during elections, influenced by the Kremlin's internet censor, Roskomnadzor. Similarly, in China, Google took down videos and profiles that criticized the government or featured allegations of corruption, under the request of governmental authorities.\n\nThe process for these removals is described as opaque, with critics arguing that Google wields too much power over information access, often without adequate transparency. In some cases, content removal was justified under laws related to copyright, privacy, or national security, but thousands of requests remained unspecified. The data shows a significant increase in such requests since 2020, highlighting the growing challenges of managing online content in politically sensitive contexts.\n\nDespite opposition from authoritarian regimes, Google has faced significant fines and continues to receive numerous requests for content removal, raising further questions about the balance between regulation, free expression, and the role tech companies play in governmental censorship."},{"title":"One dies in attempted Channel crossing after small boat sinks off Calais coast","content":"One person has died while attempting to cross the English Channel in a small boat that sank off the coast of Calais, with 69 others rescued during a busy night for crossings, according to French authorities. The small boat began taking on water before a French navy ship, Abeille Normandie, intervened. Only half of the passengers had life jackets. Two individuals were unconscious upon rescue—one was revived, while the other later died in the hospital.\n\nThis incident marks at least the fourth death in Channel crossings this year. A Syrian man died earlier this year in an overcrowded boat, and two other bodies were found following an attempted swim to a small boat. So far in 2025, over 1,500 migrants have crossed the Channel, continuing a trend that has seen over 150,000 people arrive in the UK via this route since 2018.\n\nThe French maritime prefecture emphasized the dangers of crossing in winter due to difficult weather conditions and the busy shipping lane. A representative from Utopia 56, a migrant support organization, criticized government policies aimed at reducing small boat crossings, suggesting they contribute to such tragic outcomes. The UK Home Office reiterated its commitment to ending these perilous crossings and undermining the smuggling operations that exploit vulnerable individuals."},{"title":"Mitchell return instrumental to England’s Six Nations revival","content":"Alex Mitchell's return as scrum-half was pivotal to England's revival in the Six Nations, particularly in their recent victory over France. Head coach Steve Borthwick's decision to allow Mitchell to play the full 80 minutes, rather than rotating in other scrum-halves, paid off, as it provided the team with stability and leadership. Mitchell, who had been sidelined due to a neck injury and missed several previous matches, helped steer the team during crucial moments, showcasing his importance alongside Fin Smith. \n\nMitchell expressed his satisfaction with the win and the joy of playing in front of a passionate crowd. He also noted that his absence during the autumn tests allowed him to bring a fresh energy upon his return. Now considered one of the senior players at 27, he is excited about the upcoming Calcutta Cup match against Scotland, emphasizing the importance of playing in major rivalries.

Pattinson plays Mickey Barnes, a bio-clone worker for a space-exploration corporation, who repeatedly undergoes fatal missions only to be bio-printed and reincarnated. The film critiques a tech-focused societal mindset, similar to that of figures like Elon Musk, regarding the disregard for life—both human and alien.\n\nVisually striking, \"Mickey 17\" features moments of pathos and horror, especially in its opening act. However, it struggles with pacing, at times feeling baggy and loose, with comedic elements reminiscent of children's television. Characters portrayed by Mark Ruffalo and Toni Collette add a lighter, almost whimsical dimension, contrasting the film's darker themes.\n\nThe central narrative involves Mickey's journey as he embarks on a dangerous expedition, ultimately facing unexpected complications when he encounters his own duplicate, Mickey 18. This leads to philosophical questions around the nature of death and experience, as Mickey grapples with what it means to die—an idea that remains largely unexplored throughout the film.\n\nOverall, \"Mickey 17\" offers an intriguing but confusing narrative that leans towards optimism amidst violence, with an undercurrent of philosophical inquiry. The film premiered at the Berlin Film Festival and is set for release in April."},{"title":"Chris Riddell on Donald Trump, cowardly appeaser of war criminal Vladimir Putin – cartoon","content":"Chris Riddell's cartoon comments on Donald Trump, portraying him as a \"cowardly appeaser\" of Vladimir Putin, whom he labels a war criminal.

She aims her book at readers who are politically engaged yet may not work in politics, hoping to provide tools for self-analysis.\n\nSarkar attributes her political outlook to her family background, where discussions about politics, particularly relating to anti-racism, were commonplace. She expresses concern over the increasing toxicity and racism on social media platforms since Elon Musk's takeover of X (formerly Twitter), leading her to reduce her interactions there for safety reasons. \n\nShe seeks to make a broader impact through her writing rather than traditional media, noting that books have helped her make sense of the complexities of the world. Sarkar admires authors like Frantz Fanon, Stuart Hall, and Hilary Mantel, emphasizing the significance of rigorous editing in writing. While she acknowledges the current disillusionment with democracy among younger generations, she believes in the importance of fostering hope and organizing coalitions to create political change."},{"title":"Wakefield mark Super League return with shock victory over Leeds","content":"Wakefield Trinity made a surprising return to Super League with a 14-12 victory over rivals Leeds Rhinos at AMT Headingley Rugby Stadium. Despite facing an injury crisis and being newly promoted, Wakefield played impressively, scoring three tries within a 10-minute span during the first half to establish a 14-0 lead. Leeds managed to score just before halftime through Harry Newman, but struggled to find their rhythm in the second half. Even when Wakefield was reduced to 12 men, Leeds couldn’t capitalize, only scoring again with 20 seconds left in the game. This match was part of a weekend filled with unexpected results in the Super League, suggesting a potentially unpredictable season ahead."},{"title":"Omar Marmoush’s Manchester City hat-trick demolishes Newcastle","content":"Omar Marmoush made a spectacular debut for Manchester City, scoring a hat-trick in just 14 minutes during their match against Newcastle, leading City to a dominating victory.

His second goal showcased his skill with a precise finish from the edge of the box, while his third came after a coordinated team play, highlighting City's attacking prowess.\n\nManchester City, under the guidance of Pep Guardiola, displayed a machine-like efficiency that left Newcastle struggling to keep up. Despite a shaky start where Guardiola expressed his frustration with his players, the team's performance soon improved, leaving the visitors in despair as they faced their 16th consecutive league defeat at the Etihad Stadium.\n\nMarmoush's hat-trick and City's relentless attacking efforts had fans celebrating, demonstrating when they play at this level, they pose a formidable challenge. The match ended with City continuing to exert pressure, culminating in a final goal by James McAtee, further sealing Newcastle's fate."},{"title":"Schade winner for Brentford sinks West Ham to increase Potter’s problems","content":"Kevin Schade's early goal helped Brentford secure a 1-0 victory over West Ham, exacerbating manager Graham Potter's challenges. Despite hoping for a revitalized attack with new striker Evan Ferguson and returning Lucas Paquetá, West Ham struggled offensively, creating little threat against a proactive Brentford side. Potter's squad remains 10 points above the relegation zone, but his record of one win in six matches raises concerns. West Ham continues to concede early, with Schade's goal highlighting defensive shortcomings. Although they made changes at halftime to increase momentum, Brentford held firm, affirming their mid-table stability while West Ham fell to a second consecutive home defeat."},{"title":"Watkins ensures Aston Villa point as Palmer saves day for 10-man Ipswich","content":"Ollie Watkins scored an equalizer for Aston Villa in their match against Ipswich, who played with ten men after Axel Tuanzebe was sent off.

She highlights recent surveys revealing that many young people hold both right-wing and troubling opinions, such as supporting chemical castration for sex offenders and the idea of a strong leader bypassing democratic processes. \n\nDespite these findings, Manavis criticizes the media and commentators for patronizing and mocking Gen Z instead of seeking to understand their perspectives. She notes that disparaging comments are unlikely to change minds and may instead reinforce harmful ideologies. \n\nGen Z, having grown up in challenging socioeconomic conditions and amidst rampant misinformation, needs connection and understanding, not ridicule. Manavis points to remarks from Channel 4’s Alex Mahon, who praises Gen Z's creativity and emphasizes the importance of trust and community.\n\nShe concludes that addressing the root causes of Gen Z's views requires openness and outreach, rather than alienation, to foster a more cohesive society that bridges generational divides."},{"title":"Democrats in Congress see potential shutdown as leverage to counter Trump","content":"Democratic lawmakers in Congress are currently debating how to respond to the possibility of a government shutdown, with an eye towards leveraging the situation against Donald Trump's agenda. The federal government is set to shut down if Congress does not pass a funding bill by March 14, and Democrats are divided on whether to risk a shutdown to express their discontent with Trump's radical governance.\n\nWhile Republicans are leading the charge for a funding deal, they must rely on Democratic support to overcome Senate filibuster rules. Some Democrats believe that the funding negotiations present a strategic opportunity to counter Trump’s attempts to redistribute federal resources and dismantle government agencies.\n\nHakeem Jeffries, the House Democratic leader, indicated that negotiations might be at a standstill due to Republican leadership's decisions. Democrats are calling for a clean funding bill that wouldn't facilitate Trump's agenda, with some pledging to withhold their support from any deal that doesn't align with their priorities. Conversely, other Democrats, like Cory Booker, emphasize a more cautious approach, highlighting the need to protect vital services and the potential political consequences of a shutdown.\n\nPolitical analysts suggest that shutdowns typically carry more risks than benefits for those involved, and recent history shows a significant public blame towards Trump during past shutdowns. The dynamics surrounding this funding battle are complicated by Trump's aggressive use of executive power, raising concerns among Democrats about his potential exploitation of a shutdown to further his policies. Ultimately, Democrats are recognizing their leverage but remain wary of the implications of a shutdown for both federal workers and their political fortunes."},{"title":"The week in audio: Coming Out; The Great Post Office Trial; The Teen Commandments – review","content":"The week in audio featured several notable programs recently reviewed by Miranda Sawyer. \n\n1. **Coming Out**: A moving audio documentary from Lithuania, produced by Rūta Dambravaitė and Inga Janiulytė-Temporin for LRT Radijas. It tells the touching love story of Vitalius and Albinas, who have been in a relationship for 52 years despite facing societal challenges as a gay couple in Lithuania, a country that only decriminalized homosexuality in 1993. The documentary discusses the couple's struggles, Vitalius's poignant childhood experiences, and culminates in the couple's symbolic wedding ceremony attended by 21,000 people. This program sparked important discussions about LGBTQ+ rights in Lithuania and garnered significant attention.\n\n2. **The Great Post Office Trial**: Nick Wallis continues his thorough coverage of the Post Office scandal on Radio 4.

But here’s how we in gen Z really feel","content":"The article discusses the perceptions and realities facing Generation Z (born between 1997 and 2012), challenging the stereotype that they are disengaged or disinterested in critical social elements like sex, democracy, and DIY. Despite surveys indicating substantial discontent with traditional democratic processes and a preference for strong leaders over democratic governance, experts suggest that these views stem from a broader disillusionment with the political system rather than a true desire to abandon democracy.\n\nGen Z is characterized by a mix of social attitudes; they reportedly engage less in casual sex and drinking compared to earlier generations, but there is a growing acceptance around issues like drug decriminalization and marriage. The article highlights a paradox wherein, despite perceived disengagement, there is a deep concern among young people about societal issues and a strong desire for authentic connections away from screens.\n\nThe piece argues that if Generation Z had confidence in their future—particularly regarding job stability, social services, and community—many of their negative attitudes toward traditional institutions might shift. Ultimately, the author emphasizes that understanding and addressing the underlying frustrations of Gen Z can lead to more constructive dialogue about their needs and expectations in society."},{"title":"Trump’s betrayal of Ukraine has emboldened Putin and pulled the rug from under Nato allies  | Simon Tisdall","content":"In Simon Tisdall's opinion piece, he argues that Donald Trump's policies towards Ukraine represent a significant betrayal that has emboldened Vladimir Putin and undermined NATO allies. Tisdall likens Trump to the character Alden Pyle from Graham Greene’s novel \"The Quiet American,\" portraying him as dangerously ignorant and arrogant in his attempts to negotiate peace through unacceptable concessions to Russia. These include accepting Russian territorial gains in Ukraine, denying Ukraine NATO membership, and withholding U.S. security guarantees. \n\nTisdall criticizes Trump for effectively siding with Putin, who initiated the invasion of Ukraine, and for blaming Ukraine instead. He highlights how Trump's actions have fractured NATO's unity and trust, leaving it vulnerable. The author also points to remarks from U.S. officials suggesting a shift in focus away from Europe, further diminishing NATO's purpose.\n\nThe article warns of the wider implications of this American approach, suggesting that it could embolden adversaries like China, Iran, and North Korea, and calls for a concerted effort by Western democracies to challenge Trump's detrimental impact on transatlantic security. Tisdall concludes that while the situation is dire, there is still time for Europe and the U.S. to reassert a strong united front in support of Ukraine."},{"title":"Returning Mikaela Shiffrin buoyant after ’miraculous’ fifth in slalom","content":"Mikaela Shiffrin returned to competitive skiing with a strong performance, taking fifth place in the slalom at the World Championships in Austria.

Analysts predict inflation will rise from 2.5% in December to 2.8% in January, potentially reaching 3.7% by the end of the year. The return of inflation may negatively impact households and businesses, with unemployment expected to rise to 4.5%, up from 4.4%. Although the economy showed a slight growth of 0.1% last quarter, experts are cautious about the outlook for job growth amidst rising inflation.\n\nThere are mixed forecasts regarding the economy, with some predicting stagflation characterized by high inflation and unemployment. However, others believe the unemployment rate will stabilize around 4.5% by the end of the year. The possibility of an end to the Ukraine war could result in reduced energy prices, which would help alleviate inflation; yet, current forecasts remain uncertain due to geopolitical factors, including potential trade tariffs under Trump’s administration, which may affect hiring and economic stability."},{"title":"If the AI Roundheads go to war with tech royalty, don’t bet against them | John Naughton","content":"In John Naughton's article, he discusses a potential civil war within the tech industry regarding the future of artificial intelligence (AI). He contrasts two factions: the \"AI Cavaliers,\" who aim for artificial general intelligence (AGI), and the \"AI Roundheads,\" who focus on efficiently solving specific problems with AI. \n\nNaughton critiques major tech companies like Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta for their massive investments in AI, which he argues may not yield a viable business model. He suggests that their motivation is driven by a fear of missing out and the desire to avoid returning excess profits to shareholders. The entry of China's DeepSeek-R1 signals that there may be alternative, less resource-intensive paths to AI, challenging the prevailing brute-force computing approach favored by these American giants.\n\nHighlighting successes from DeepMind under Demis Hassabis, Naughton points out that the Roundheads have made significant advancements by focusing on targeted applications such as protein folding and drug discovery.

This treatment involves injections of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) derived from the patient's own blood, which may help regenerate the olfactory nerve responsible for smell, a unique capability among cranial nerves.\n\nKelly, who lost her sense of smell after developing sinusitis in 2012, described her condition as feeling like a bereavement. While some patients typically regain their sense of smell after a viral infection, others, like Kelly, do not. She has since experienced phantosmia (smelling things that aren't there) and parosmia (distorted smell perception).\n\nResearch led by Prof. Zara Patel indicated that PRP could aid in nerve regeneration, with trials showing more significant effects over time compared to placebo treatments. The hope is to roll out this minimally invasive procedure across the NHS, especially since PRP is already used in other treatments and poses fewer regulatory challenges.\n\nAs Kelly continues her treatment, she remains cautiously optimistic about its effectiveness.

His comments underscored a dramatic ideological divide between the Trump administration and European leaders, moving beyond traditional military concerns to deeper societal values.\n\nVance criticized established European elites, suggesting their actions had undermined democracy and freedom of speech, elevating instead the populist right. He framed the \"greatest danger\" to Europe not as external threats from Russia or China, but as internal challenges stemming from what he viewed as a disconnect between the ruling elite and the electorate.\n\nHis remarks implied that if European leaders feared their voters, then the United States could not offer support. He articulated that NATO's purpose might be compromised if the democratic values it was meant to defend were no longer shared between Europe and the U.S. This shift not only redefined political discussions but also shook the foundations of joint security efforts.\n\nResponses from European leaders, such as German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, highlighted their commitment to confronting extremist ideologies, with Scholz stressing Germany’s resolve against parties rooted in historical fascism.

Business owners are responding by adjusting their strategies, seeking alternative suppliers, and building inventory to mitigate the effects.\n\nThe article raises questions about the long-term efficacy of Trump's tariff strategy in creating a level playing field for American businesses and improving economic conditions.

Reese, co-founder of City of Asylum, reflected on the incident and described how the audience, an engaged community of readers, instinctively rushed to help Rushdie, a phenomenon he termed the \"reader effect.\" This effect suggests that reading fiction fosters empathy, which contrasts sharply with the declining rates of fiction readership in the U.S., where only 38% of adults reportedly read a novel or short story in 2022.\n\nReese emphasized that the lack of fiction reading exacerbates ideological polarization and reduces empathy among individuals. He cited research showing that non-readers tend to be lonelier and less tolerant of differing perspectives. To combat this trend, he noted that arts organizations could emulate the \"reader effect\" through community programming and interactions that foster empathy and understanding.\n\nReese recounted an earlier event in 2005, where an exiled poet's performance brought a diverse audience together, demonstrating how shared artistic experiences can create connections analogous to those found in reading fiction. He concluded by urging the importance of community in fostering freedom and empathy, echoing Rushdie’s beliefs on the necessity of communal living for true freedom."},{"title":"Coconut chicken, hispi with beans and pork with pineapple: Ravinder Bhogal’s recipes for winter braises","content":"Ravinder Bhogal presents three comforting winter braises: \n\n1. **Aromatic Coconut Chicken and Potatoes**: A whole chicken braised in a rich coconut milk broth with spices.

Despite the intention behind trigger warnings to prepare audiences for potentially distressing content, Maltby highlights evidence from interviews and studies suggesting that these warnings can inadvertently heighten anxiety and physiological reactions, such as fainting among audience members.\n\nThe play, which is based on the works of Annie Ernaux, has garnered attention for its portrayal of female experiences, yet it has unintentionally been branded as \"the abortion play.\" Maltby references the experiences of the play's director, Eline Arbo, who noted that in performances without trigger warnings, there were fewer adverse reactions compared to those where warnings were prominently displayed.\n\nAdditionally, the article conveys that PTSD triggers are often unique to individual experiences and do not necessarily stem from content that aligns with one's past trauma. Maltby argues that by focusing on trigger warnings, the true essence of the narratives and the broader themes of the play may be overshadowed, ultimately complicating the audience's engagement with the material.\n\nMaltby concludes that while trigger warnings may help some individuals, they can also sensationalize the content and disrupt the storytelling, thereby detracting from the authentic experiences being conveyed on stage."},{"title":"Extreme weather expected to cause food price volatility in 2025 after cost of cocoa and coffee doubles","content":"Extreme weather is predicted to cause significant volatility in food prices throughout 2025, with cocoa and coffee prices having more than doubled recently—up 163% and 103%, respectively. Research by the consultancy Inverto indicates that rising temperatures and extreme weather events are hampering crop yields, leading to these price spikes.

The film pioneered a style of storytelling about adolescents that highlighted their complex inner lives beyond typical high school stereotypes. It successfully filled a gap in the film industry for authentic representations of young people, contrasting sharply with both corny after-school specials and raunchy comedies of the time.\n\nDespite its impact, the film has faced recent scrutiny regarding its portrayal of relationships and themes, particularly in light of evolving societal norms.

Recently, Sir Jim Ratcliffe's minority investment in the club was hailed as a positive development by fans. However, shortly thereafter, the club announced further job cuts and staff benefit reductions, which were attributed to the need to reduce costs amid financial difficulties.\n\nDespite predicting an Ebitda profit of £145-160 million for the year ending June 2025, the club has also disclosed over £300 million in pre-tax losses over the past three years. This duality arises from differing definitions of profit, often influenced by what stakeholders aim to convey—whether to investors or fans. A significant factor contributing to these losses is the club's heavy expenditure on player transfers, amounting to £2.1 billion since 2013, which has left them with substantial outstanding transfer fees, primarily owed to other clubs.\n\nAdditionally, operational costs remain high, with over £340 million in recent years on player amortisation and other expenses. This financial strain has been further exacerbated by the Glazer family's management decisions, including costs associated with the sale of shares to Ratcliffe, leading to mixed financial signals from a club that has historically been a financial powerhouse.\n\nWhile Manchester United continues to generate considerable revenue, criticisms arise around their approach to managing staff and costs, creating a complex narrative where the club must navigate both profit and loss amidst ongoing concerns from fans about financial sustainability and ownership."},{"title":"‘Rugby can be pretty complicated’: Cole and Youngs tackle plain speaking in hit podcast","content":"Dan Cole and Ben Youngs, two veteran players from the England rugby team, have launched a podcast titled \"For the Love of Rugby.\" This platform allows them to share insights and experiences from their long careers in rugby, offering a unique perspective that differs from traditional media interviews.

Dannatt stressed that a strategic defence review would be ineffective unless the defence budget increases to 3 or 3.5% of GDP, rather than the current proposal of 2.5%. He raised concerns that prioritizing health and education over defence could compromise national security. Starmer's suggestion for potential UK troop deployments to Ukraine as peacekeepers was also criticized, given the current limitations of the British military. Meanwhile, the UK government faces pressures to bolster defence spending to support NATO commitments amid global security concerns."},{"title":"WWF helping facilitate trade in polar bear fur, investigation reveals","content":"The WWF has been revealed to be facilitating the trade in polar bear fur while simultaneously using images of polar bears for fundraising. This comes amid concerns over the decline of polar bear populations due to climate change and habitat loss. \n\nCanada remains the only country allowing commercial hunting of polar bears, with around 300-400 skins exported annually, primarily to China. Although the WWF advocates for sustainable use of species, including polar bears, critics argue this approach is counterproductive and could lead to greater declines in populations. \n\nWWF has lobbied against full protection for polar bears at international meetings, asserting that the trade does not significantly threaten the species. However, this position is contested by many wildlife protection organizations, reflecting broader divisions on the issue.\n\nIndigenous voices, like that of Iñupiat guide Robert Thompson, highlight alternative income sources from eco-tourism rather than hunting. Internal critics within WWF have expressed concern that the organization's support for such trades may be at odds with its conservation goals, sparking shock within the conservation community."},{"title":"Blind date: ‘I really enjoyed chatting to her – even when she critiqued my dating app profile!’","content":"Matthew, a 24-year-old tax consultant, went on a blind date with 25-year-old advertising executive Izzy.

After initially thriving through strategic acquisitions and benefiting from a robust chemicals market, the company’s fortunes have reversed due to rising costs and declining refinery earnings post-COVID and after the energy crisis following the Ukraine invasion. \n\nIneos has seen a significant drop in profits, with reports indicating a profit decline from €2.28 billion in 2022 to just €407.8 million in 2023. Additionally, subsidiary losses have raised alarms about the company’s financial health, especially with a looming debt of nearly €12 billion. This situation echoes past financial crises where Ineos had to renegotiate debt repayment terms to avoid insolvency.\n\nRatcliffe's foray into the automotive industry with Ineos Automotive has been costly, reportedly consuming €1.4 billion since 2018 and accumulating substantial debt, compounded by supply chain issues. Moreover, his ownership of Manchester United has led to drastic cost-cutting measures deemed necessary to stabilize the club's finances and restore its competitive status.\n\nThe overarching narrative suggests that while diversification has aimed to bolster Ratcliffe's empire, the struggles in both the chemical and automotive sectors—coupled with external economic pressures—indicate a potential miscalculation in this ambitious business strategy."},{"title":"How to turn an old bread crust into a delectable British pudding – recipe | Waste not","content":"**How to Turn an Old Bread Crust Into a Delectable British Pudding – Recipe**\n\nTreacle tart is a classic British dessert perfect for using stale bread.

At a conference in Munich, Vance criticized Germany's current government just before elections where the far-right AfD party is expected to perform strongly. His meeting with AfD leader Alice Weidel breaks a political taboo in Germany, indicating a willingness to engage with extremist factions.\n\nAnalysts suggest that while Vance's actions might not directly influence the German elections or prompt the ruling parties to ally with the AfD, they reflect a broader objective of the U.S. right under Trump to support populist movements across Europe that align with their isolationist and anti-immigration stances. Leaders like Hungary's Viktor Orbán and Italy's Giorgia Meloni are seen as allies in this mission.\n\nVance’s strategy indicates a dismissal of traditional diplomatic protocols, as he avoided meeting with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, implying a shift in priorities towards populism and voter sentiment over established alliances. This approach mirrors Trump's tendency to redefine global relationships based on electoral mandates rather than historical diplomatic ties.\n\nThe involvement of U.S. politicians in European far-right politics raises questions about potential policy implications and the nature of future U.S.-European relations, hinting at significant changes that could disrupt the political landscape."},{"title":"OpenAI rejects $97.4bn Musk bid and says company is not for sale","content":"OpenAI has rejected a $97.4 billion bid from a consortium led by Elon Musk, stating that the company is not for sale.

The meeting, which took place in Munich, involved discussions about the war in Ukraine, German politics, and the barriers preventing ultra-nationalist parties like the AfD from participating in governing coalitions.\n\nThis meeting comes ahead of German elections where the AfD is expected to perform strongly amid rising anti-establishment sentiments. Vance's engagement with Weidel follows previous controversies, including remarks made by Elon Musk, who has publicly supported the AfD. Notably, Vance did not meet with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, suggesting a strategic alignment with far-right factions in Europe rather than established political leaders.\n\nVance's comments at the Munich Security Conference criticized European leaders for avoiding engagement with far-right parties, further fueling tensions between the US and its European allies. Scholz responded firmly, citing historical lessons from National Socialism as a reason for maintaining a consensus against extremist parties. The reception of Vance’s remarks in Germany was largely negative, with various officials condemning his comparisons of Europe to authoritarian regimes. Overall, Vance’s actions signal a potential shift in US political strategy toward embracing far-right elements in Europe amidst ongoing geopolitical complexities."},{"title":"Brighton v Chelsea: Premier League – live","content":"Brighton hosted Chelsea in a Premier League match where Brighton dominated early on.

They have taken control of significant areas, including the Kazingu and Bagira zones, with ongoing gunfire reported as they move towards the city center. The city, home to about 1 million people, has seen many businesses close and civilians flee due to fear of escalating violence.\n\nIn the days leading up to this, the rebels seized control of the Kavumu airport and captured other strategic locations, including Kabamba and Katana along the N2 road. The M23 group's recent advances culminated after seizing Goma, the capital of North Kivu, in January. Concerns over the humanitarian situation have intensified, with a reported 350,000 people now displaced due to the conflict.\n\nThe conflict in eastern DRC has historical roots in ethnic tensions and involves various armed groups, with the M23 notably being supported by Rwanda, which claims to be targeting extremist groups. However, international reports suggest that Rwanda is exploiting mineral resources through these groups.\n\nThe situation has drawn international attention, with calls for de-escalation and support for the Congolese government, now represented by Prime Minister Judith Suminwa Tuluka at the African Union summit, while President Félix Tshisekedi is abroad seeking assistance. The fighting has resulted in significant civilian casualties, most recently highlighted by the murder of a popular Congolese singer, raising further concerns about the safety of civilians amid the unrest."}];
